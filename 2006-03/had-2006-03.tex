One night during my radio show, as I'm wont to do, I was
randomly looking through Wikipedia, reading whatever interesting
articles came up. One evening, I came across the entry for 
{\em Samizdat}: the illicit, often hand-copied literature that
worked its way through the underground in the old Soviet Union.
I thought that it would be a neat basis for a collaborative
work: something copied out by hand and distributed one-by-one
through the mail.

I haven't worked out the details, but if you are interested
in this idea, send me an e-mail.

mail.\\
