The weather here in Ames has finally seemed to swing around firmly
to Spring. This winter wasn't as harsh as others have been, but
we had some cold days, some warm days, back to cold. But in the
past couple of weeks we've gotten rain and little bits of hail,
and I'm starting to really look forward to spring.

Last weekend was KaleidoQuiz 2006, the 26 hour trivia marathon that
the radio station at ISU puts on. This year, I worked the radio
station side, which was amazingly fun. For those of you curious,
it only takes five people to pull an empty CyRide bus.

Rail grinder goes by \\
A Hades of sparks shoots out \\
A sinew of light.

Then bills take away
