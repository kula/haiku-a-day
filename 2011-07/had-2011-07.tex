Six years down, eh? That's nearly thirty-seven thousand syllables, over two
thousand haikus, and untold numbers of times I've sat at a coffee shop or
at the laundromat putting together that month's issue of HAD. 

Last month was also a spectacular month. Aside from making it through another
birthday (if 30 is the new 21, then 33 is the new 24, but most 24 year olds
only wish they were as awesome as this) I had a great vacation driving out
and hanging out for six days in New York City. And, frankly, I've been bitten
by the bug (and not a bed bug --- I checked for those!) It's my goal to live
there by this time next year, and it awoke in me the gumption to actually
look for a new job. Is it a hairbrained scheme? Absolutely. But sometime
you gotta take the hairbrained schemes and see where they go....

Until next month, enjoy.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

Why two pounds of peas? \\
Why not use three pounds of peas? \\
That sounds good to me.

Could the pea salad \\
Just not want to get eaten? \\
Damn food poisoning

This day, sleepy haze \\
And no appetite, defined \\
It passes quickly

Very brightly lit.

My house a right mess \\
But I'm still on vacation \\
So who gives a fuck?

A lazy morning \\
A quiet lunch at Beezy's \\
Ugly Mug, then nap

30 July 2011

Plans for these last days \\
Foolishly made; why did I \\
Think they would get done?

31 July 2011

Try to do dishes \\
Getting through the stacking phase \\
I fail at washing
