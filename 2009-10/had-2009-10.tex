Halloween seems to have really gotten me ready for the 
end of the year --- this mad rush to 2010 is just a few
holiday bumps away.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 October 2009

The rain obscuring \\
Lines in the road blury, dark \\
Making driving fun

2 October 2009

Wandering about \\
Showing relatives around \\
Chocolate is found

3 October 2009

A grey sky above \\
The fruits of nature laid out \\
Walk in the Market

\newpage

4 October 2009

I am random junk \\
Look upon all these craft stores \\
And you will dispair

5 October 2009

The train departed \\
Leaves me tired but happy \\
What better, a nap.

6 October 2009

What can Tuesday say? \\
Not a start, middle or end \\
Just there, existing

7 October 2009

Little beetle fly \\
Your time has come to be off \\
My place not your home

8 October 2009

They Might Be Giants \\
Playing at St. Andrew's Hall \\
The night was rockin'

9 October 2009

Glorious day off \\
Possibilities endless \\
Ends up in napping

10 October 2009

Small iceburg floating \\
Takes heat to keep a drink cold \\
Then it's forgotten

\newpage

11 October 2009

Spiral of wire \\
Twisting, turning, grabbing cork \\
Opens the bottle

12 October 2009

Light, hitting glass, slows \\
In some parts more than others \\
A lens brings focus

13 October 2009

Tiny globes glow green \\
Floating in soup, or salads \\
Peas, small rounds of good

14 October 2009

Trees loom over us \\
And when the wind blows they shake \\
Showing their fury

15 October 2009

We dance, for doughnuts \\
Have manifested themselves! \\
Unlimited joy.

16 October 2009

Grey sky blanketing \\
A cold that fills me with life \\
I walk, warm, content

17 October 2009

Once again I find \\
My craftiness ideas far \\
Exceed my skill set

\newpage

18 October 2009

Small things compounding \\
In a blink, become large things \\
Oh woe my dishes

19 October 2009

Shoulda stayed in bed \\
This week is not welcoming \\
I'll try for the next

20 October 2009

A package not found \\
Suddenly, it arriving \\
Brightens my dull day

21 October 2009

As I do dishes \\
The Flaming Lips are playing \\
I scrub; they keep tune

22 October 2009
 
Is frozen pizza \\
Healthy when it is dinner \\
Three nights in a row?
 
 23 October 2009

 Package, forgotten \\
 Suddenly in my post box \\
 A pleasant surprise

 24 October 2009

 ``It's on the shelf there" \\
 Several minutes later \\
 Guess where it is found?

\newpage

25 October 2009

A pleasant bike ride \\
Cider and doughnuts appear \\
What could be better?

26 October 2009

One day, sometime soon \\
I'll be able to slow down \\
Today's not that day

27 October 2009

Thirteen years cover \\
Comes off in a few minutes \\
My chin feels cold

28 October 2009

Arise, ye sleepers! \\
Is what my alarm clock would  \\
Say if I set it

29 October 2009

Bits of yarn abound \\
As if my carpet, shedding, \\
Is freeing its coat

30 October 2009

Rain does not deter \\
Zombies and zombie hunters \\
Mass slaughter occurs

31 October 2009

Cleaning up mold leaves \\
A faint tickle in my throat \\
Coffee does not quench
