I hate winter.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 February 2008

Snow falls, covering \\
The land in crisp blinding light \\
Quickly ground to mud

\newpage

2 February 2008

Elbow of morning \\
Jabbing into sleep's sore ribs \\
Bruising, unforgiving

3 February 2008

I spill, water falls \\
A rush to clear the table \\
Paper thrown asunder

4 February 2008

'Twas night in Ypsi \\
And dancing through my head was \\
Visions of pointers

5 February 2008

Rain drips in puddles \\
Causing snow to melt away \\
A glimmer of spring

6 February 2008

Awash in a light glow \\
Ypsilanti before me \\
As I wander home

7 February 2008

Walk the circumference \\
With a diameter guide \\
The ratio pi

8 February 2008

Nothing has power \\
If you take away zero \\
Mathematics hurts

\newpage

9 February 2008

Friends with everyone \\
Benford has a law for it \\
One, identity

10 February 2008

My mind pondering \\
A square root that bends numbers \\
Imaginary

11 February 2008

The natural base \\
Springing from logarithms \\
Fine identity

12 February 2008

What happens, I ask, \\
If I put some m-n-ms  \\
Into my blender

13 February 2008

A thin veiny leaf \\
Dancing in the bitter wind \\
Harkens things to come

14 February 2008

The world upside down \\
The ceiling becomes the floor \\
In my little world


15 February 2008

In a perfect world \\
Days would be fourty hours \\
I would take long naps

\newpage

16 February 2008

Standing in the cold \\
Bikers arrive, I send them \\
Off to Ambrosia

17 February 2008

The dripping of rain \\
Is a sign of spring to come \\
Each drop is new life

18 February 2008

I walk out of work \\
And the sun is still shining \\
What is that bright thing?

19 February 2008

Cold. Cold cold cold cold. \\
Cold cold cold. Cold. Cold cold cold. \\
Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold.

20 February 2008

The brush, growing damp \\
Is covered with a cold paste \\
That scrubs my teeth clean

21 February 2008

Down to the laundry \\
Slide card load clothes add some soap \\
Whirl and they're clean

22 February 2008

The table wobbling \\
Sends my tea stumbling, spilling \\
Damp napkin, spirt 

\newpage

23 February 2008

Potholes blossoming \\
Like mushrooms from all the roads \\
Except not tasty

24 February 2008

Ceaselessly moving \\
The sun dances through the sky \\
Day to night to day

25 February 2008

Where does one find a \\
Blade of grass in this city \\
Untouched by the snow

26 February 2008

When my brain spins fast \\
And things start making some sense \\
I get a bit scared

27 February 2008

An errant pinky \\
Where metal and metal meet \\
Jumping and shouting

28 February 2008

Dark cranial caves \\
Ignored, forgotten. They sulk. \\
And my head explodes.

29 February 2008

No lords a leaping \\
But the day is leaping here \\
And that's all that counts
