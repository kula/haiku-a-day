Well, folks, after nearly six years in Ames it looks
like I will be moving. For a while I've been looking
around for another job, something that was more in 
line with what I wanted to do. And now, I've been
offered a position at the University of Michigan.
So, baring any miracle on the part of ISU, I will be
moving by the end of the month --- and let me tell
you, moving does not fill me with much joy. But I'm
sure I'll survive. I think it's the only way I'll
ever get my garage cleaned out.

So, by this time next month, your Haiku a Day may 
appear from The People's Republic of Ames, newly
located in Ann Arbor. We'll see what happens.

--- Thomas

Downloadable version available at website, or if you really
want me to send you one, send me your address, maybe a
stamp too. I enjoy getting mail as much as I enjoy sending
mail. Of course, I have no idea what my address may be at
this point....
