False spring came, only to be dashed by the harsh reality
of the last desperate grasp of winter. Someday it will be
warm again, so I can stop complaining about the cold.

Of course, then I'll complain about the heat. There just is
no satisfying some people, isn't there?

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 February 2009

The magic smoke flees \\
The arm is stopped, motion lost \\
At least no alarms

2 February 2009

Stuck in the same day \\
It too early for flapjacks? \\
When is tomorrow?

3 February 2009

Sudden cold shocks me \\
It was so nice yesterday \\
What happened last night?

4 February 2009

Rock Band is awesome \\
Early Weezer is easy \\
Black Sabbath defeats

5 February 2009

From Pittsfield Township \\
The smell of corn sweetener \\
Where does it come from?

6 February 2009

Winter's dying gasp \\
Explodes on the land and fades \\
The winds of spring blow

7 February 2009

A sigh of relief \\
Warm air washes over me \\
The sky brightly blue

\newpage

8 February 2009

A day of baking \\
Cooking, cleaning, laundry done \\
I'm ready for bed

9 February 2009

A hole in my shoe \\
Salt wearing away canvas \\
I need to patch it

10 February 2009

The pantry hides some \\
Seriously weird items \\
When did I buy this?

11 February 2009

Recliner! Genius! \\
A chair made for lounging in \\
Sit, relax, enjoy!

12 February 2009

False spring comes and goes \\
A brief glimmer of hope shines \\
And is dashed by clouds

13 February 2009

Name space exhausted \\
The Captain causes panic \\
Fast disapated

14 February 2009

Spoon fold fold fold roll \\
Grape leaves stand loose when I want \\
Neat little bundles

\newpage

15 February 2009

Dishes then cooking \\
Leads to a dirty sink and \\
No gumption to wash

16 February 2009

Confusion do over \\
Not paying attention sucks \\
Only took four times

17 February 2009

Wake early morning \\
No more sleep for me this morn \\
Coffee is my balm

18 February 2009

Staying late at work \\
Making me miss Rock Band Night \\
I will drum next week

19 February 2009

Should we stay or go? \\
Passthrough is weird, we decide \\
A week more is good

20 February 2009

Elbow Room rockin'  \\
The tunes of Wally Dogger \\
Blast the room with sound

21 February 2009

Pizza craving strong \\
I sucumb and order one \\
Too lazy to cook


\newpage

22 February 2009

Ginger beer burning \\
At last strong enough for me \\
Let's see how it fares

23 February 2009

Salt eats many things \\
But putting holes in my shoes? \\
That seems a bit much

24 February 2009

I've barely been here \\
But the sink is almost full \\
Must have dishes gnomes

25 February 2009

In the morning rush \\
I forgot to take my lunch \\
Eating out today

26 February 2009

Exhaustion tonight \\
The brain, wanting nothing, slacks \\
I hope its done soon

27 February 2009

Tiny French presses \\
Just perfect for making tea \\
Line the shelf, shiny

28 February 2009

Cold yet bracing day \\
The sun shining bright on high \\
Will the cold leave us?
