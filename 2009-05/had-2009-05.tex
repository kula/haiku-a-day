A bit late this month --- I was off at the 2009 AFS and Kerberos
Best Practices workshop (one of my talks was 27 slides in 
five minutes and thirty-nine seconds) last week, and I spent a
couple extra days wandering around San Francisco. Conversely, I 
now have a ton of photos to upload and this issue to finish up
and get out the door.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 May 2009

Workers of the world \\
Unite! You have nothing to \\
Lose but your sorrow.

2 May 2009

A sunny morning \\
At the depot, tasty food \\
Yay, Farmer's Market

3 May 2009

Sunday afternoon \\
The park loud, people biking \\
I smile, happy

\newpage

4 May 2009

Somewhere is a box \\
In it, a part that I need \\
Someday, I'll find it

5 May 2009

I lean on a shelf \\
It shifts, some books shuffle down \\
I should not do that

6 May 2009

In a building sits \\
A room of sand, unfinished \\
Waiting to be used

7 May 2009

O Mystery Jar \\
What secrets are you keeping \\
Hidden in my fridge?

8 May 2009

Water soft, ice hard \\
Both conspire to destroy \\
Michigan's roadways

9 May 2009

This cord, twisted hard, \\
What monkey put it away? \\
That monkey was me.

10 May 2009

Three times I have looked \\
Where something should be, later \\
It appears right there

\newpage

11 May 2009

Seriously, dust \\
Where the hell do you come from? \\
I so hate sneezing

12 May 2009

Uploads take too long \\
Stupid pipe, be more faster \\
My data must go!

13 May 2009

With a flop it goes \\
Scrambled eggs falling aren't bad \\
But hot sauce stains well

14 May 2009

Nearly half way through \\
The month of May, flying by \\
Will soon be over

15 May 2009

Towering over \\
Dishes stacked ominously \\
The sink grows distressed

16 May 2009

Brave cyclists roaming \\
Finding junk from far and wide \\
Cleaning up the roads

17 May 2009

Polo rocked today \\
Things made sense, I scored a goal \\
And I didn't crash

\newpage

18 May 2009

Boxes, bags to move \\
A car, stuffed full, lumbers on \\
Back and forth, a lot

19 May 2009

Kimchee on two days \\
Is there anything better \\
I do not think so

20 May 2009

Why do you not run? \\
Init says you should restart. \\
I hate this machine

21 May 2009

Warm weather settles \\
And collectively a sigh \\
Flows across the land

22 May 2009

Late at the wedding \\
Limbered up, I show all the \\
Universal dance

23 May 2009

You're in a code maze \\
Twisty passages, alike \\
Bends straighten, make sense

24 May 2009

Two goals at polo \\
A goal three weeks in a row \\
It's kinda scary

\newpage

25 May 2009

I tear you apart \\
O creaky bottom bracket \\
You quiet a bit

26 May 2009

It's doughnuts we seek \\
A meeting gone on too long \\
We do not find them

27 May 2009

I love short work weeks \\
They are so good we should have \\
Them every week

28 May 2009

Where is that book at? \\
I know for sure I own it \\
But it's in no box

29 May 2009

Conference next week \\
Guess I should write my talk then \\\
Procrastination

30 May 2009

Errands all day long \\
At least I was productive \\
And got in a nap

31 May 2009

The talk, now finished \\
Needs a lot of practice runs. \\
Stay strong, my poor throat
