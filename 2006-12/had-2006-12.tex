I'm sitting in a coffee shop in Ann Arbor, which
is a decent enough place, although I have yet to find
a shop around here that makes tea properly. They all
just dump boiling water right on the leaves, the
philistines....

Anywho, they keep giving out free baked goods ---
I gather they must be getting new pastries soon.
So far I've had a chocolate-chip scone and a pretty
good bagel. I'm kinda glad I haven't had dinner yet.

1 December 2006

Farewell to sweet Ames \\
To that which has been my home \\
I bid fond adieu 


\newpage

2 December 2006

Night in Chicago \\
Where else would I go to get \\
Ice cream when it's cold

3 December 2006

Fair Ypsilanti \\
Long city on a river \\
On your edge I live

4 December 2006

Fluffy plastic clouds \\
Stand guard over my shower \\
Water shall not pass

5 December 2006

The pod has arrived \\
It seems a shame that I must \\
Now unpack it all

6 December 2006

A light taste of snow \\
Dusting the ground; then ghostlike \\
It is whisked away

7 December 2006

My dear couch returns \\
O Heavenly place of naps \\
Cushions I adore


\newpage

8 December 2006

Drive an endless loop \\
The maps in my head don't match \\
The real Ann Arbor

9 December 2006

Green pine tree dancing \\
Gyrating to the loud wind \\
I turn and you mosh

10 December 2006

Cooking smells waft by \\
The warm comfort of good food \\
True serenity

11 December 2006

To work I journey \\
Orientation boredom \\
Lots of paperwork

12 December 2006

Swift waters flowing \\
Burble below the bridge planks \\
Brief cry, then silent

13 December 2006

Infinite sadness \\
Keycards that have the wrong keys \\
Entry is denied


\newpage

14 December 2006

Awake before dawn \\
Sky becoming a cool blue \\
As I bus to work

15 December 2006

Blinky lights flashing \\
A connection close but far \\
You get no network

16 December 2006

Footprints on carpet \\
Whose feet have walked here before? \\
Who comes after mine?

17 December 2006

Anticipation \\
A patio garden plan \\
Though I suck with plants

18 December 2006

Joy of connection \\
My interwebulation \\
Is wired for speed

19 December 2006

Frost settles outside \\
I make a cocoon of warmth \\
As night passes by


\newpage

20 December 2006 

Bright light in the sky \\
Astronauts circle the earth \\
As darkness falls here

21 December 2006

A free feast at work \\
Geek talk and grazing on food \\
Protocols and pie

22 December 2006

The sky fades to black \\
One sun turns into millions \\
Bright beams now twinkle

23 December 2006

TSA strip tease \\
No belt no shoes take out keys \\
Do I trip your wand?

24 December 2006

Goofy relatives \\
Better with each passing year \\
Known and comforting

25 December 2006

Gifts from Santa Claus \\
Mom and Dad still use those tags \\
After all these years


\newpage

26 December 2006

"Even hot peppers?" \\
Pile them on high, I say \\
Boy, that was stupid

27 December 2006

Detroit Wayne County \\
Runways, tunnels and parking \\
I hate flying so

28 December 2006

Microwave weird noise \\
Perhaps I'll get superpowers \\
Behold: MicroMan!

29 December 2006

Swirling hot water \\
Washes away daily dirt \\
Spraying your skin clean

30 December 2006

A swish on the dish \\
Soapy suds take away dirt \\
Leave a lemon scent

31 December 2006

Rain pours from the sky \\
Washing away the old year \\
Waiting for the new
