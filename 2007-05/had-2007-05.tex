The summer continues and Ypsilanti is a beautiful place. 
Nice parks and neat neighborhoods to walk through, a good
coffee shop to hang out in, interesting things going on.

What more could anyone want?

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated.

Cities travel by \\
Sparkles of light in the night \\
A bump, and I'm home

13 May 2007

My car dead again \\
Maybe I should let it rot \\
And give up driving

Advertising makes sight bleak \\
On the bus ride home

Nearly six months here \\
Bedrooms still full of boxes \\

Who can make some awful noise? \\
The leafblower can.

Presently the moon \\
Rises over the dark land \\
Casting silver rays

23 May 2007

A harsh wail cries out \\
And screaming, racing away \\
Goes the ambulance

Soft pillow beckons \\
Calling me to deep slumber \\
Whispering sweet dreams

Skittering away \\
A spilt newspaper escapes \\
Breeze bringing freedom

A box spills over \\
Books fall, crushing my poor toe \\
I spit out an oath

27 May 2007

The couch whispering \\
"A nap would be so nice now" \\
I nod, and agree

While geese look on placidly \\
At Riverside Park

Make room for new groceries \\
Then put them away

Coils spinning in their fields \\
Electricity

Leafy green treetops \\
Poking above the bus stop  \\
Shading the riders
