It's Fall, I have real apple cider. Not much is wrong with my world.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 September 2010

Hours in the car \\
Michigan to Iowa \\
Makes one glad to stop

2 September 2010

First too hot, then cold \\
This blanket lacks in-between \\
Half on, half off works

\newpage

3 September 2010

Wireless almost \\
An ethereal yoga \\
Just to get signal

4 September 2010

The day dawning cool \\
I'm thankful for the weather \\
In a goofy suit

5 September 2010

Things slower today \\
Welcome from running around \\
To sit and find calm

6 September 2010

Hours and miles \\
Wind behind me, like a trail \\
Between there and here

7 September 2010

Bored with newspaper \\
I attempt to make a hat \\
Have no head for it

8 September 2010

I'm on vacation \\
And yet my brain won't turn off \\
Just go to sleep, brain

9 September 2010

Hours spent coding \\
At my local coffee shop \\
Strangely relaxes

\newpage

10 September 2010

Unsure what to eat \\
The number 10 satisfies \\
Coney islands rock

11 September 2010

Today I will Clean! \\
Okay, instead I will just clean. \\
Give me a break, `kay?

12 September 2010

Back in the saddle \\
After an absence too long \\
It feels good to ride

13 September 2010

Ten days off work \\
And I forget what we do \\
Read e-mail, I guess

14 September 2010

My brain turns to mush \\
As this insipid song plays \\
Cork my ears oh please

15 September 2010

The healing power \\
Better than all medicines \\
Perfect, simple soup

16 September 2010

Divebombing house fly \\
Pulls up, lazy spiraling \\
Leave my airspace now

\newpage

17 September 2010

The afternoon drags \\
Delaying still the weekend \\
Soon that breaks, it's here

18 September 2010

The day is too packed \\
And there is no tomorrow \\
To do all these things

19 September 2010

Wandering Pittsburgh \\
There is topography here \\
All of it uphill

20 September 2010

I am on the bus \\
And using the internet \\
I love the future

21 September 2010

Going overboard \\
Is easy when making soup \\
Use your biggest pot

22 September 2010

The draw of cider \\
Starts its yearly temptations \\
Call of doughnuts strong

23 September 2010

Summer, a last burst \\
Bright blue skies and warm breezes \\
Give a last hurrah

\newpage

24 September 2010

Molasses flowing \\
Goes faster than this machine \\
It crawls and I sigh

25 September 2010

The cold drawing near \\
Causes me to draw inward \\
I go out refreshed

26 September 2010

Alluring orange juice \\
Drawing me out of the house \\
These cravings are weird

27 September 2010

With a snap, cold falls \\
The degrees sliding downwards \\
Pulling leaves with them

28 September 2010

Squinting at the sky \\
And when did it start raining? \\
This should not surprise....

29 September 2010

Having broken this \\
We try it again to see \\
If the breaking stops

30 September 2010

Glad to close windows \\
The house, once cool, now grows warm \\
Winter's on its way
