5981!

That's how many words I have in my NaNoWriMo novel. I'm so far behind.
Oh, well, I always was a finish everything at the last minute anyways.

Four months down, who knows how many to go. Now seen in seven states,
and three countries!

Enjoy.

Or did the can opener? \\
Which way did it go? \\

Sounds across the cold prairie \\
Going far away \\

In a silver rocketship \\
Astronaut away \\

New scarf and hoodie
Gloves to keep my fingers warm

Roots go deep into the earth \\
Leaves form on branches \\

Late night wandering \\
When the rest of the world sleeps \\
I like to be up \\

Eight kids, five visits \\
I answer wearing a kilt \\
And give them candy \\
