For the July 2013 special edition, I did a double-sided
'hidden' hand-written version of the zine. Here's the 
contents for reference.

July 2013 Cover
A bit of folding
Careful layout, handwriting
I hope you enjoy

1 July 2013

For Canada Day
Fresh poutine, Strange Brew playing
Stand on guard for thee

2 July 2013

Data transfering
Bits of pictures uploading
Things frozen in time

3 July 2013

Hardware delivered
Dinner consumed, beer now gone
I got paid for this

4 July 2013

We stare down the street
Fireworks in the distance
For a bit, life stops

5 July 2013

Up late, not too late
Got some work done, now a nap
I think I've earned it

6 July 2013

Ball of string falling
Not lost, I know where it went
But I don't like it

7 July 2013

A day of culture
An abstract Russian I like
Art discovery

8 July 2013

The goal of tickets
Get them down under forty ---
Up to fifty-five

9 July 2013

Machine precision
Lines ruling regularly
Tree guts line the back

10 July 2013

Do not seek the Sun
It will find you, do not fear
Sunscreen will not help

11 July 2013

In it is a book
Grocery lists, pocket stains
Uncap it and write

12 July 2013

Friday night gumption
Has me cooking up a storm
Eating mellows me

13 July 2013

Turn on all the taps
The water flowing slowly
Will trickle on down

14 July 2013

A hot night, pommes frites
Ugly building exhales cold
On the street I eat

15 July 2013

Just one thing to do:
Watch old British sitcoms and
Order in pizza

16 July 2013

Turning song lyrics
Into a haiku --- lazy
I won't do it here

17 July 2013

Okay, in the past
I made song lyrics haiku
We all make mistakes

18 July 2013

How did I anger?
The train gods ruin some plans,
With the worst timing

19 July 2013

Some folks bemoan; but
Thirty-five isn't for wimps
I'm not backing down

20 July 2013

A Saturday night
With good friends, good food, whiskey
What more do you need?

21 July 2013

The joy of pickles
Sharp, sweet, sour, salty, good
Just like life itself

22 July 2013

When life hands you rain
You duck inside for a slice
Pizza restores hope

23 July 2013

Humidity hangs
With a crack, the sky opens
The hangs becomes rains

24 July 2013

The Sun angers me
Aluminum foil fix
Try to get through that!

25 July 2013

Back to work today
Reading e-mail I wonder:
What do I do here?

26 July 2013

A machine, six years
My digital life returns
Third time I've seen it

27 July 2013

You win, MTA
In Poetry in Motion
There is happiness

28 July 2013

Eighty-years standing
What has this apartment seen?
Do you want to know?

29 July 2013

A grainy photo
Slices history, dragging
The past into now

30 July 2013

Noble Juice Cart Guy
Slice squeeze stir pour happiness
You are my hero

31 July 2013

Oh ConEdison
You show me two different
Amounts that I owe
