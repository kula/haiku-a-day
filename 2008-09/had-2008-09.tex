You will probably be curious why this issue is a double issue, and
why there are no haiku the first week of September. Some of you know
this already, but for others, my father passed away 31 August 2008.
It was sudden, but not surprising, since he had been in poor health
the past couple of years. And, he went quickly, at home, and with
Mom, which is all he ever wanted. The amazing number of people who 
did amazing things for my family has been imcredibly humbling, and
I'm glad for all of it.

So, by the time I returned to Ypsilanti and got settled back in, 
August was more than halfway gone --- so instead of sending two
issues out with so little time between them, you got a little wait
and then a double issue. I hope you enjoy it.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 August 2008

Falling waters hush \\
The sound of nature living \\
A rainbow pleases

2 August 2008

Produce brightly sits \\
The bounty of Nature shown \\
The market this morn

\newpage

3 August 2008

Sticker sticker there \\
Why you stuck upon the chair? \\
Do you find that fair?

4 August 2008

As August anew \\
Arranges accordingly \\
All act axiously

5 August 2008

The current flowing \\
Lights glowing, the machine wakes \\
Starts humming; thinking

6 August 2008

Little tiny plums \\
Drip dropping juice on the ground \\
The ground takes a drink

7 August 2008

Thursday stretches out \\
Long, extended, never ends \\
I'd maim for a nap

8 August 2008

I see a star, bright \\
Burning with a quiet heat \\
In the sky so cold

9 August 2008

Streets crumble, skies burn \\
Whailing and gnashing of teeth \\
I am out of cheese
 

\newpage

10 August 2008

Dancing in my head \\
Visions of cinnamon rolls \\
I'm in bed, sighing

11 August 2008

The light blinks, they're off \\
The morning rush exploding \\
Traffic on the street

12 August 2008

Peas peas peas I love \\
Tiny green spheres of pure joy \\
Plain or in salads

13 August 2008

The bus rushes by \\
Plants bow in passing as to \\
An ancient queen

14 August 2008

Soft, quiet humming \\
Roasting, making beans tasty \\
The fragrance devine

15 August 2008

A sight to behold \\
Morning, starting, a new day \\
Life is glorious

16 August 2008

The night sky explodes \\
Fireworks at Frog Island \\
Bright colors, loud sounds

\newpage

17 August 2008

Seasons are shifting \\
Days drawing closed earlier \\
Autumn awaits us

18 August 2008

The whirlygig comes \\
Gears gnashing spinning maelstrom \\
The smell of oil

19 August 2008

It is new shoes time \\
The sole worn, holes pushing through \\
I must let them go

20 August 2008

Pillow curled tight \\
Reveals a neck that's scrunched up \\
Bent, twisted, painful

21 August 2008

A whirling coil \\
Spins in a magnetic field \\
Pushing electrons

22 August 2008

The sky sighing soft \\
Releases warm breath, pausing \\
Before the rain starts

23 August 2008

Dancing in the air \\
A spider dangles, twisting \\
Weaving a fine web

\newpage

24 August 2008

The pressure holding \\
Mixing gases and liquids \\
Makes bubbly water

25 August 2008

Wire, twisted, bent \\
A flat coil holding tight \\
Paper stuck within

26 August 2008

Stacks of boxes make \\
Finding something in a box \\
A dull painful task

27 August 2008

Apples gone sour \\
The mother broods murkily \\
Hiding in the jar

28 August 2008

Shiny steel surrounds \\
Separate strange screwdrivers \\
Sitting still, singing

29 August 2008

Oh, the long weekend \\
Stretched gloriously ahead \\
Ripe with potential

30 August 2008

I'm lost, wandering \\
Floors of books spread before me \\
A grin on my face


\newpage

31 August 2008

Pizza aftershock \\
My stomach unhappy as \\
I start a new day

1 - 6 September 2008

No haiku

7 September 2008

Asleep, the rain starts \\
A grey day as I awake \\
Brightens to deep blue

8 September 2008

Leaves falling softly \\
Growing wet as rain comes down \\
Fall's foundation starts

9 September 2008

I think of cider \\
Of apples hanging, juicy \\
Swaying in the breeze

10 September 2008

Of cooler weather \\
Getting out sweaters and scarves \\
And dusting off gloves

11 September 2008

Nights woken by frost \\
The air crisp, clean, breath fogging \\
Nose burning with cold

\newpage

12 September 2008

I know it comes soon \\
And in time I will hate it \\
But now, I embrace

13 September 2008

Rain, drenching, falling \\
Running in streams down the street \\
Faint rivers, fading

14 September 2008

Rain will not stop us! \\
There are tacos to be had, \\
Even if we're damp

15 September 2008

O, blinky light dead! \\
Rain and grit have destroyed you \\
Can you be rescued?

16 September 2008

Hunger's a strange pain \\
Fading in and out, sharp, dull \\
I should eat dinner

17 September 2008

Planning a long ride \\
Details take a lot of time \\
At least there's coffee

18 September 2008

You lost the tape, MACC \\
I can see it, you scanned it \\
Why can't you find it?

\newpage

19 September 2008

Winding to an end \\
The week reaches Friday \\
The people rejoice

20 September 2008

Trees prepare to sleep \\
Evening sun shines, last bright rays \\
Highlights their colors

21 September 2008

Wheels spinning chain whirrs \\
Feet pedal a long cycle \\
Mallet hitting ball

22 September 2008

Simple words: crock pot \\
Yet from you comes food divine \\
For good food, add time

23 September 2008

I sing a song: beans! \\
Glorious simplicity \\
A meal for the gods

24 September 2008

In your head, lurking \\
Pressure building in dark caves \\
Weary, sore, headache

25 September 2008

Robot Ninja fights \\
Saving the folks of Ridgway \\
When friends die, he feels

\newpage

26 September 2008

Debate droning on \\
Neither filling me with hope \\
I'm used to it now

27 September 2008

A state of boredom \\
Nothing sounds interesting \\
And so on, endless

28 September 2008

Sad socks growing holes \\
Showing toes, needing mending \\
Heel unraveling

29 September 2008

Strangely sore I wake \\
Wondering what I did that \\
Makes my body gripe

30 September 2008

Doughnut! The word joy \\
A simple pastry I love \\
Plain, unassuming
