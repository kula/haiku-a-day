A bit late this month --- The Bike Ypsi Spring Festival was
the first weekend in May, so I was running around doing stuff
for that. It was a fabulous day. About 150 people showed up,
we lucked out again with gorgeous weather, and I had a kick
as time both at it and hanging out with folks at the Corner
Brewery afterparty.

And now I rush to print this off before going to see the new
{\em Star Trek} movie.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 April 2009

Thing built long ago \\
Could have been done easier \\
Now I think of it

2 April 2009

A concert tonight \\
But then I grow too tired \\
And I just go home

\newpage

3 April 2009

At the laundromat \\
I am used to smelling soap \\
But smelling French fries?

4 April 2009

Across the landscape \\
Lines of steel bend and wander \\
I hurtle along

5 April 2009

April showers bring \\
May flowers, but what comes from \\
an April snow storm?

6 April 2009

Zines and records tempt \\
Wandering through Chicago \\
They jump in my arms

7 April 2009

A line, high tension \\
Electrons scream, silently \\
Quiet becomes light

8 April 2009

Kill time at the park \\
A giant shiny orb sits \\
Watching me reading

9 April 2009

When you become bored \\
Sometimes you make up a game \\
Count to one thousand

\newpage

10 April 2009

Random inventions: \\
Who first twisted some wire \\
Making coat hangers?

11 April 2009

Flash on or flash off? \\
Go slower or go faster? \\
This sign has options.

12 April 2009

The tree out front is  \\
Budding, and all down the street  \\
Springtime is now here

13 April 2009

Grating and stiring \\
Filter, pour into bottles \\
A new brew is born

14 April 2009

Cap quickly opened \\
Ginger beer gushes about \\
Tricksy cinnamon

15 April 2009

My mind not thinking \\
Gets coffee at nine pm \\
My mind racing now

16 April 2009

Those tings! that I heard \\
Not one but two spokes snapping; \\
My tire needs work

\newpage

\newpage

17 April 2009

This race is not one \\
But we had a nice ride and \\
Hung at the Corner.

18 April 2009

Again, espresso \\
Makes my brain a whirling mad \\
Wonderful engine

19 April 2009

A mini tune up \\
A fine way to pass the time \\
I should clean my chain

20 April 2009

Just when things make sense \\
A bizzare error throws me off \\
I must think on it

21 April 2009

A strident whistle \\
Wresting me from my slumber \\
I log in, bring calm

22 April 2009

Dig through code again \\
My brain hurts and wants to stop \\
So I head for home

23 April 2009

Belly of ramen \\
Glowing with added kimchee \\
What could be better?

\newpage

24 April 2009

I'm an idiot \\
To think my apartment would \\
Be cleaned Friday night

25 April 2009

Hours at the Mug \\
Caffeine helps me write some code \\
Now my brain is fried

26 April 2009

Epic slo-mo crash \\
Seat bent, gash in my right shin. \\
Hotties dig scars, right?

27 April 2009

Oh, couscous, devine \\
That tiny pasta so neat \\
But is it pasta?

28 April 2009

What day is today? \\
Is today really Tuesday? \\
I get so confused.

29 April 2009

The protector fades \\
Keys cover becomes dirty \\
And so do the keys

30 April 2009

Organizing stuff \\
My living room starts to fill \\
Piles everywhere
