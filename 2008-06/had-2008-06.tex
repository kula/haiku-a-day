Another month, another batch of haiku. Next month
will be the three year anniversary of Haiku a Day.
I'll have to see if I can come up with something 
extra crafty for it.

Also, note the new PO Box address on the back cover
--- since I've moved, I'm actually within walking
distance of a post office here in Ypsi.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 June 2008

The pack is heavy \\
The ride long and exhausting \\
But the food is good

2 June 2008

Almost did not go \\
But the show was amazing \\
The people awesome

\newpage

3 June 2008

The jacket amiss \\
The rain pours down and the sky \\
Thunders in laughter

4 June 2008

My life in mazes \\
No matter which way I turn \\
Boxes define paths

5 June 2008

Heat and humidity \\
Force people to rush inside \\
Cool lemonade flows

6 June 2008

The wisest one works \\
Selling us snacks in a train \\
Smart people listen

7 June 2008

While Twins are losing \\
The Jordan Keys are returned \\
And fireworks fly

8 June 2008

The bursting salad \\
Scalding soup, and bread galore \\
I ate way too much

9 June 2008 

The places I touch \\
Infintesimal, compared \\
To what I pass by


\newpage

10 June 2008

Drip drop the rain falls \\
Buses lumber by, splashing \\
Dry shoes a faint dream

11 June 2008

``Die a soapy death!" \\
I shout to dirt on my clothes \\
``You're no match for me."

12 June 2008

Old cars making noise \\
Shiny metal lines the street \\
Crowding Depot Town

13 June 2008

Escape from New York \\
Pain, but I can't look away \\
I thought you were dead

14 June 2008

Biking through the streets \\
I pedal until I I'm home \\
Tired and alive

15 June 2008

A candle glowing \\
A reminder of the Sun \\
On a summer's night

16 June 2008

Through lenses of glass \\
Foggy, scratched and well worn out \\
I gaze at the world


\newpage

17 June 2008

We did not start this \\
There is in fact a whole song \\
About this fire

18 June 2008

There are schemes afoot \\
Going all over this town \\
You must find the clues

19 June 2008

Flow Huron River \\
Through the city where I live \\
Your time here is short

20 June 2008

Green the grass growing \\
The leaves high up in the trees \\
Fields sway in the breeze

21 June 2008

Who baked the first cake? \\
How long did it live before \\
Frosting was first made?

22 June 2008

Frosty glass holding \\
A tasty chilled beverage \\
Root beer is for me

23 June 2008

Sinus explosion \\
Take them out, get rid of them \\
I do not want them!
  

\newpage

24 June 2008

Insomnia blows \\
My brain racing won't shut up \\
The sheep are afraid

25 June 2008

Unplanned late laundry \\
The spin of clothes hypnotic \\
The smell of clean calms

26 June 2008

Nine hours on the road \\
Where a radio station \\
Plays TMBG.

27 June 2008

Downtown Rochester \\
Jennie and I go for food \\
I buy a notebook

28 June 2008

Storms are chasing me \\
Driving across Wisconsin \\
Mirrors show dark skies.

29 June 2008

Plans are being made \\
The Depot Town Thunderdome \\
I hope there are trains

30 June 2008

Evenings well spent there \\
A corner; my usual \\
Tea or rooibos
