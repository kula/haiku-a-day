Okay, helpful tip: don't bike from Ypsilanti to Ann Arbor
and then drink a large iced mocha.

Bad idea.

Trust me.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated.

1 April 2007

Ypsilanti streets \\
Growing quiet in the night \\
The city's dull roar

2 April 2007

Early to bed, say? \\
I tried that, now I'm awake \\
It's 10, not sleepy

3 April 2007

Sitting by the pond \\
I see geese jump and take flight \\
Into the night sky

4 April 2007

At my apartment \\
The water laps at old trees \\
Dripping with green moss


\newpage

5 April 2007

Brushing by green grass \\
The snow whirls in the wind. \\
Spring pauses for now.

6 April 2007

Generator roars \\
A puff of black smoke rises \\
Load testing at MACC

7 April 2007

A Saturday night \\
Staring at dumps for hours \\
Not those dumps, sicko.

8 April 2007

Sunday afternoon \\
Vacuuming the living room \\
This vac really sucks

9 April 2007

Yerba mate drink \\
On the third steep in my press \\
Cool emerald green

10 April 2007

My cell phone locked up \\
Asking for a PUK \\
For a second time

11 April 2007

Leaving on a jet \\
Tomorrow in the morning \\
Going to Des Moines


\newpage

12 April 2007

Airlines suck goat ass \\
Randomly canceling flights \\
Now I sit and wait

13 April 2007

Flashing by my eyes \\
Twenty-four frames per second \\
Still becomes active

14 April 2007

Tearing up the floor \\
Dancing at my friends wedding \\
Now I want more cake

15 April 2007

Monterey stuffing \\
Whenever I visit there \\
I eat way too much

16 April 2007

High up in the clouds \\
A place where birds can not go \\
The sun beams brightly

17 April 2007

Looming high above \\
Stacks of pans, precarious \\
Danger when I cook

18 April 2007 

A cat placidly \\
Saunters past a line of cars \\
Sniffing the tires

\newpage
19 April 2007

Ride to Ugly Mug \\
On a beautiful evening \\
The bus takes me home

20 April 2007

Bicycle to work \\
Coming home is easier \\
Since it is downhill

21 April 2007

I think of Bob Ross \\
On Saturday afternoons \\
Happy litle trees

22 April 2007

Caressing my face \\
The spring breeze brushes past me \\
Racing to the sky 

23 April 2007

A weeks cooking turns \\
Into leftover dinner \\
Bits of this and that

24 April 2007

I need bookcases \\
I consult the internet \\
It knows where they are

25 April 2007

I am bored tonight \\
So I drink tea at the mug \\
Take that, stupid sleep


\newpage

26 April 2007

Oh Thursday Thursday \\
A yabba yabba blursday \\
Okay, that's enough.

27 April 2007

All of the hotties \\
Here at the Mug are smokers. \\
This makes me feel sad.

28 April 2007

Ducks chase each other \\
As the Huron flows by them \\
I watch from a bench

29 April 2007

A leaf whirlpools down \\
An iron storm drain grating \\
Water gurgles by

30 April 2007

Crabapple blossoms \\
Tempt me with a sweet fragrance \\
As I head from work
