Note: for the July 2007 issue I did a special format to celebrate
the second anniversary of Haiku a Day: a hand-written 1/8th sheet
format, instead of the normal printed 1/2 sheet format. So no
PDF for this month, but here's all the text for it.

Haiku a Day
Issue 25
July 2007

Two years have gone by
With haikus every day
Here's to many more

A special edition this month, friends - thought
I'd do something different. More at the website,
or write me and I'll send you one.

1 July 2007

What book should I read
A stack of them looms nearby
I pick at random

2 July 2007

A box of flowers
Petals blowing in the wind
A bee buzzes near

3 July 2007

The sun beaming down
Warms the ground that lies below
And thus, the lawn grows

4 July 2007

The pea salad looms
Bright in my mind; In the fridge
Tempting me to eat

5 July 2007

Shaky table hate
You're making it hard to type
And you spill my tea

6 July 2007

An evening well spent
A long letter to a friend
And a box of zines 

7 July 2007

The race of sevens
I serve as the Greed checkpoint
Out on Stadium

8 July 2007

Oh my sweet A/C
I hug your chilly carpace
And hear your sweet drone

9 July 2007

A new bike beckons
On the Croque Monsieur I zoom
Through Ypsilanti

10 July 2007

Paper leaves on stems
Hanging down from the ceiling
Dangling from a string

11 July 2007

Inside a machine
Data is bouncing around
Becomes creative

12 July 2007

Jeremy slighted
A zine with two front pages
Sadness in the mail

13 July 2007

A candle flickers
Causing little things to dance
As distant giants

14 July 2007

"Let me greet the day"
Says the Sun as it sholders
Through the horizon

15 July 2007

Is the word in there?
Is it in your hallowed list,
O Dictionary?

16 July 2007

They Might Be Giants
I'm playing their album Flood
And feel strangely sad

17 July 2007

Sleepy comes early
I want to read 'till Midnight
But I go to Nod

18 July 2007

Thanks nice bus lady
You saw me walking and stopped
To let me get on

19 July 2007

Ypsilanti walk
Exploring new neighborhoods
And enjoying life

20 July 2007

The Bizarre Bazaar
A zombie in a black dress
Demands a haiku

21 July 2007

I hate morning calls
Waking me up from slumber
Telling me bad news

22 July 2007

The dishes are done
Laundry clean, groceries got
I sit back and rest

23 July 2007

I am a tea pot
Here's my handle, here's my spout
When done, tip and pour

24 July 2007

No more hospital
The nurses, tired of Dad
Made him go away

25 July 2007

I'm hanging out at
The Secretary of State
And feel like Kafka

26 July 2007

In the southern sky
Flashes of light arc across
The clouds above them

27 July 2007

With a dark rumble
The skies above open up
And drench us with rain

28 July 2007

I have a new lamp
It's casting a golden glow
In my living room

29 July 2007

The drone of the fan
Lulls me from my book to sleep
As the day grows dim

30 July 2007

Flicker, then darkness
A few clicks bring back the light
My lamp needs some work

31 July 2007

Water and pressure
Against which the beans must yield
Releasing dark gold
