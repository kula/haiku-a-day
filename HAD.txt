In June of 2005 I was at a conference in Pittsburgh
and used the opportunity to visit one of the best
bookstores in the world (Copacetic Comics 
). There I picked up a copy
of the first of Snakepit anthology,
a collection of the daily comics Ben Snakepit 
decided to start drawing back in XXXX.

Reading it late at night, I had the idea
to do something similar: write a haiku a
day, collect them up at the end of the month,
and send them to friends. While I don't 
mean for it to be a diary (like Ben's comic
is), what you have in your hands sometimes 
reflects what was happening that day, or 
what I happened to be thinking about.

Note to purists: while the Japanese poem
form known as the Haiku has more behind it
than the 5/7/5 syllable form, that's all
I'm using it for.

Enjoy.

I walk through the waking park
Awaiting summer

12 March 2006

Miraculous day!
My livingroom is now clean.
The Gods themselves gasp.

13 March 2006

Wind is cold again
I sleep with the window up
My cocoon of warmth.

14 March 2006

Describe a circle
Find the ratio within
Three point one four two

15 March 2006

I leave work early
Feeling crappy all day long
Sleep the day away

16 March 2006

A world full of snot
Head cancer is my ailment
My lungs hate me now

17 March 2006

Schaumberg royalty
Books of stamps come in the mail
A gift from afar.

18 March 2006

A voice of a frog
Graces the late night air waves
Sounds funny to me

19 March 2006

A few hundred march
And that is just here in Ames
Now we must get more

20 March 2006

What can I offer?
Can I make a better world?
Will it overwhelm?

21 March 2006

Hottie in the bus:
Tonight's CyRide driver had
Some kick-ass blue hair

22 March 2006

Dust on the book shelves
Falling upon stacks of tomes
Envelope of earth.

23 March 2006

Seasons are changing
Snow gives away to the rain
Scarves to umbrellas

24 March 2006

I crave a pizza
During my radio show
Every Friday

25 March 2006

Fareway Grocery
I used to go with my Mom
I shopped there today

26 March 2006

Job applications
I know I'm a good person
So just hire me

Photons zoom through space
A minute fraction of them
Give to you a star

28 March 2006

Lines become a grid
Blossoming black and white stones
The ancient game Go

29 March 2006

Gigs of parity
The raid array is building
I must wait hours

30 March 2006

The power flickers
I hover anxiously to
Shut down my machines

31 March 2006

A loud boom outside
Muffled, off in the distance
Wonder what it was

1 April 2006

From the Earth's center
To the surface of this land
A rock's eon trip

2 April 2006

A patter of rain
Makes me feel warm and secure
In my little home.

3 April 2006

Quiet, the sun rise.
Life gives birth to a new day.
The cycle repeats.

4 April 2006

Bag falling apart
Safety pins strain to contain
The bulk that's inside

5 April 2006

Five hours of smoke
Did not help my lungs at all
Coughing becomes hoarse

6 April 2006

Stomping Grounds outside
A clear day and a cool breeze
People strolling by

This ticker is sad
Blood does not flow as it should
Vessels need some help

Eastern Iowa
The flat praire grows hilly
And hills become bluffs

Frozen pizza land
A bready disc is your home,
Cheese inhabitants

10 April 2006

Vomit gushes forth
A stomach in full revolt
Acid and bile

11 April 2006

Brie plate and salad
My first real food in a day
Be still, my stomach

12 April 2006

People out mowing
What the hell is wrong with you?
Too early for that.

13 April 2006

Greetings, Campustown
The spring storms come to join you
And then wave goodbye

14 April 2006

Should I see that here?
Space disorientation
This tea is *damn* good

15 April 2006

Bowels of Friley Hall
Radio speaks to far lands
Or at least Huxley. 

16 April 2006

Hot water wells up
Suds float and take dirt away
Washing the dishes

17 April 2006

Crocheted ipod sock
Next to a pot of hot tea
Table detritus

18 April 2006

The loopy ice cream
A shake with some espresso
Rich and cold caffeine

19 April 2006

SG Network SUCKS
Commericial Internet will
Be our great savior

The afternoon sun
Lends itself to a picnic
A day in the park

24 April 2006

Go little bunny!
Racing across my front yard.
It dodges my feet.

25 April 2006

This network sucks ass
The packets don't go anywhere
Business Internet

An April evening
Becomes surprisingly cool
I want my sweater

Anywhere to anywhere
Twenty-five years old

Apple cinnamon pastry
This is my breakfast

Strands of it become a nest
Twiggy little home.

A flock of bunnies
In a burrow near my house
Cuteness overload.

Tiny little seed
A kernel of life within
Life from small to big.

Pomp and Circumstance is played
New graduates made

Doo WAH WAH WAH WAH!

16 May 2006

Hard on the outside
And flimsy on the inside
A great thing: the book

17 May 2006

Laugh of a toddler
A bike flies past on the street
Joyous bumpy ride

18 May 2006

Broken metal spring
Cap lost in the daily grind
Former safety pin

19 May 2006

Biking on Ross Road
Alone in the depths of night
All I hear is me.

20 May 2006

Loud twittering birds
Sudden motion, a divebomb
A wormy breakfast

21 May 2006

The whir of mowing
The smell of freshly cut grass
Spiffy looking lawn

22 May 2006

Tiny flat rock bits
Slip and slide past each other
Clay is useful stuff

23 May 2006

The hum of a chain
A bicycle zips on by
The rider a blur

24 May 2006

Loud vagina talk
What the hell is he saying?
Idiots outside

25 May 2006

This script breaks some things
Your job is to make them right
An afternoon spent

26 May 2006

That test was easy
A lame certification
Meaningless nonsense

27 May 2006

Morning comes too soon
Why can't it come around noon?
Makes me see maroon.

28 May 2006

When the time is right
And life is as it should be
Perform the Happy Dance

Bocce balls clicking
Searching for a far rabbit
Hidden in the grass

Kerberos kicks ass
I want to have its children
With hot ticket love.

In Ames, Iowa
The best coffehouse ever
Long live Stomping Grounds.

Stars in the night sky
A milky band of light form
Our home galaxy

Glow on a nest of cables
My world connection

Deep within the Earth
Intense pressures make rocks melt
Fiery red magma

From tiny rocks to windows
From the beach to home

Tree branches sway in the wind
Bright in the noon sun

The planets gyre in space 
Celestial song

Little bird tweeting
Hopping along the sidewalk
A flutter flies off

And a rich chocolate malt
A true summer lunch

Now where did my suitcase go?
It gets filled with stuff

Going to Des Moines
Leaving on an aeroplane
TSA likes me

The water's not deep enough
Suboptimal pool

15 June 2006

I tell Moose of Spangmato
Much laughter ensues

Thank you Bernoulli
Your principle helps me fly
And for that I'm glad

Mark and Sarah give a ride
Jason takes me home

It's nice to be back
The laundry kinda sucks though
Go clothes, be more clean

19 June 2006

Baby squirrels jump
Running around a small tree
Nibbling tiny seeds

Getting my swing back
No motivation to work
And I want a nap

Entwined in a bundle lift
Great loads in the sky

Hat of braded straw
Grass twisted to provide shade
Keeping my head cool

I have chocolate
Why am I not eating it
That's a good question

28 June 2006

I hate you, Amtrak
I'm tearing off your head and
Shitting down your throat

29 June 2006 

The light of the day
Sifting through the window shade
Fades as the sun sets

30 June 2006 

Sweat beads on a glass
A cool glass on a warm day
The napkin grows damp

Lazy week ahead
Post-vacation vacation
Time to do nothing

13 July 2006

Shambled living room
The vacuum cleaner meets you
A clean carpet here

14 July 2006

Hot. Too fucking hot.
The depths of Hell here on Earth.
The Sun is cooler.

Dawn! The crack of noon!
Slumber broken by the time
Blankets defeat me.

The sizzle of eggs cooking
The paper to read

Laughs no one else understand
Private secret joy

I have not biked for some time
Your hill defeats me.

Goes once more around the sun
Circumnavigage

Zig-zag chair backing
Shirt pressed, waffle impression
Dull people-grater

Airlines suck for everyone
But they make it home

Go my little fan
Move more air, faster faster!
Feh, you are useless.

Scratch ink on paper
Wise words for the future age
Or grocery list?

24 July 2006

Getting up before
The Crack of Noon sucks real bad
I need vacation.

25 July 2006

The smell of old books
Dry yet musty, pleasant smell
Knowledge for ages

26 July 2006

A quiet corner
In some deep hidden basement
The job that I want

Why do you not mount?
You hate me, shadow image.
A login hook fails.

A million earths could fit there
But it looks so small

Three rows of four on a tray
A dozen delights.

Gurgle gurgle spit spit spit
The teeth brushing song

Settles on my bookcases
A bother to clean

I must have this app!
The English chair demands it
I hate you, Canvas

Require registration
Really chap my ass

Deeper down more details show
Lost infinities

When you square the sides.

Long metal snake stretches out
Slow, plodding, now gone

Peanut butter and mayo:
Weird, yet still tasty.

I bet you would like to see
My primary key

Oh, is it Monday today?
It certainly is.

22 August 2006

A car alarm blasts
A wretched cacophony
Honk pause honk pause honk

23 August 2006

A long drive back home
The grey skies are behind me
Waiting to let loose

24 August 2006

Roads go on and on
Tiny threads joining far lands
Do they ever end?

25 August 2006

How does power work?
I flick a switch and lights glow
What's at the far end?

26 August 2006

Am I thinking it?
Does the Universe go when
I am sleeping sound?

27 August 2006

My car rambles on
Shake, rattle, shimmy and clang
It has ``character''

28 August 2006

Slow rain from the sky
Puddles form on grassy lawns
Ground sighs with delight

29 August 2006

A new bag delights
It's got room for everything
And kick-ass design

Floating in the breeze
Gently colored clouds fly high
And fade into mist

Gliding off on fair breezes

Why do I crave those fried treats?
Oh sweet potato

Hopping outside my window
Look, and you are gone

Eating leaves and pooping dirt
My butt recycles

A cool night outside
Bugs twitter, traffic goes by
Patio people chat

5 September 2005

Loud night grows quiet
Rough concrete beneith my feet
A bus takes me home

6 September 2006

A damp sweat builds up
Moisture on an ice cream glass
It sweats so I don't.

7 September 2006

Swirling hum of air
A fan propells air around
Artificial breeze

8 September 2006

Descending softly
A leaf flitters to the ground
Return to the Earth

Old calendar hangs
You never know when oh-four
Might make its return

10 September 2006

Monsoon season starts
Rivers of rain on concrete
Seeking bare soil

11 September 2006

Oh, spaghetti night
You fill my heart with much joy
Need you more often

12 September 2006

Gliding on my bike
Flying along west Ames streets
The wind at my back

13 September 2006

Rode hard yesterday
Why was I a speed junkie?
Because now I hurt.

14 September 2006

Dust on the ceiling
Stuff with a tenuous hold
Falls about my head

15 September 2006

When John Darnielle sings
You shut your mouth and listen
Do not talk out loud

16 September 2006

A monsoon of rain
Robert gives me a ride home
When the skies open

17 September 2006

Weekends are fun when
They aren't two long boring days
I need more gumption

18 September 2006

It's not the nineteenth?
Monday confusion fills me
My head is a blur 

19 September 2006

Mates of State rock me
Organs and drums, clear voices
A simple beauty

A good concert brings
A wave of calm to my nerves
Peace and happiness

Walk for a sammich
Cool days are here among us
My sweater is nice

Laid back friday afternoons
Prepare the weekend

Thus says my television
Magical glow box

Rain so thick you can not drive
Windshield wipers flick

Thin, green and somewhat threadbare
It needs vacuuming

Kaki King smiles
Beautiful tunes float on by 
And I become peace

Little flakes of snow
Dancing gaily in the wind
Skitter down to Earth

To my parent's house
An evening at the old home
The couch is not soft

13 October 2006

Visit Madison
An interview there goes well
You should hire me

14 October 2006

I have found Nesbitts
Honey lemonade delights
The gods' own nectar

Wind blows against me
My legs unridden too long
Slow going by bike

16 October 2006

Madison likes me
Another chance to visit
And get more cheese curds

17 October 2006

Waking while it's dark
Fine when you go back to sleep
Not going to work

O Sic Transit Gloria
You had a good run

19 October 2006

The rice has fallen
The container was not sealed
Tasty food scatters

20 October 2006

The clothes rod falls down
Laundry bops me on the head
Clean shirt avalanche

21 October 2006

Books, glorious books
A shelf haphazardly full
A clutter of joy!

22 October 2006

Madison again
I can see the Capitol
From my hotel room

23 October 2006

Another long drive
Some tunes keep me company
Heater keeps me warm

24 October 2006

College algebra
A book of mathematics
Numbers dance for me

25 October 2006

Yay! Cheap pizza day!
Half a pineapple, all mine
Burp down with soda

26 October 2006

The sleepy is strong
Office naps do not work well
I need a couch here

27 October 2006

A crisp fall evening
Leaves skitter as the wind blows
The sigh of autumn. 

28 October 2006

Into the aether
"Monster Mash" is sure to make
Confused aliens

Rampaging waters swirl
The toilet goes flush

One becomes two becomes three
As clock hands gyre

Great grimacing gears
Knashing and tearing metal
Tin parts, can opened

7 November 2006

Little night lite shine
Alone in the night, your bulb
Keeps away the dark

Colocation found
My machines will have a home
I need to find one.

9 November 2006

I am moving soon
Must enjoy all of Ames that
I then will not have

10 November 2006

Six years has been fun 
But Michigan calls to me 
I must heed its song.

My last day will be 
November the Twenty-eighth
Two-thousand and six

11 November 2006

Putz around Des Moines
Waldo seeks an apartment
And finds Mars Cafe

12 November 2006

Lights on the tower
Beating out an endless tune
Beacon to the sky

New computer parts
I put together a box
To send off to Flint

Important stuff box
Things I must not lose track of
Essentials of life

Flutter of boxes
Bringing order to chaos
My life in small cubes

23 November 2006

Thanksgiving alone
A feast among the boxes
Not as good as home

24 November 2006

Goodbye my fair couch
Away in Ypsilanti
I will next see you

25 November 2006

After some hard work
My living room is now bare
The upstairs is next

26 November 2006

Velvet mist pours down
A damp grey November day
Winter holds a bit

27 November 2006

A beerless Waldo
Is there anything more sad?
The Universe weeps.

28 November 2006

End of an era
Time passing at ISU
Flows for me no more

29 November 2006

Good bye, my fair pod
All my stuff I shall not see
'Til Ypsilanti

30 November 2006

My oven survived
For five years without cleaning
Yet I clean it now

1 December 2006

Farewell to sweet Ames
To that which has been my home
I bid fond adieu 

2 December 2006

Night in Chicago
Where else would I go to get
Ice cream when it's cold

3 December 2006

Fair Ypsilanti
Long city on a river
On your edge I live

4 December 2006

Fluffy plastic clouds
Stand guard over my shower
Water shall not pass

5 December 2006

The pod has arrived
It seems a shame that I must
Now unpack it all

6 December 2006

A light taste of snow
Dusting the ground; then ghostlike
It is whisked away

7 December 2006

My dear couch returns
O Heavenly place of naps
Cushions I adore

8 December 2006

Drive an endless loop
The maps in my head don't match
The real Ann Arbor

9 December 2006

Green pine tree dancing
Gyrating to the loud wind
I turn and you mosh

10 December 2006

Cooking smells waft by
The warm comfort of good food
True serenity

11 December 2006

To work I journey
Orientation boredom
Lots of paperwork

12 December 2006

Swift waters flowing
Burble below the bridge planks
Brief cry, then silent

13 December 2006

Infinite sadness
Keycards that have the wrong keys
Entry is denied

14 December 2006

Awake before dawn
Sky becoming a cool blue
As I bus to work

15 December 2006

Blinky lights flashing
A connection close but far
You get no network

16 December 2006

Footprints on carpet
Whose feet have walked here before?
Who comes after mine?

17 December 2006

Anticipation
A patio garden plan
Though I suck with plants

18 December 2006

Joy of connection
My interwebulation
Is wired for speed

19 December 2006

Frost settles outside
I make a cocoon of warmth
As night passes by

20 December 2006

Bright light in the sky
Astronauts circle the earth
As darkness falls here

21 December 2006

A free feast at work
Geek talk and grazing on food
Protocols and pie

22 December 2006

The sky fades to black
One sun turns into millions
Bright beams now twinkle

23 December 2006

TSA strip tease
No belt no shoes take out keys
Do I trip your wand?

24 December 2006

Goofy relatives
Better with each passing year
Known and comforting

25 December 2006

Gifts from Santa Claus
Mom and Dad still use those tags
After all these years

26 December 2006

"Even hot peppers?"
Pile them on high, I say
Boy, that was stupid

27 December 2006

Detroit Wayne County
Runways, tunnels and parking
I hate flying so

28 December 2006

Microwave weird noise
Perhaps I'll get superpowers
Behold: MicroMan!

29 December 2006

Swirling hot water
Washes away daily dirt
Spraying your skin clean

30 December 2006

A swish on the dish
Soapy suds take away dirt
Leave a lemon scent

31 December 2006

Rain pours from the sky
Washing away the old year
Waiting for the new

1 January 2007

Once more 'round the Sun
Circles have no start, no end
Yet we mark one here

2 January 2007

Quiet night steals sleep
Throws it away restlessly
Laughing all the way

3 January 2007

When I fall asleep
Do those last thoughts go to a
Graveyard of ideas?

4 January 2007

Puddles form outside
A tiny ocean of life
Born, lives, fades away

5 January 2007

Bang clang shudder boom
Music my apartment makes
When the heat turns on

6 Janaury 2007

Streets to streets to streets
Aimless wandering at night
Finding my way home

7 January 2007

Molecules excite
Atoms drop energy and
Photons create light

8 January 2007

Flakes of water fall
Specks glide from on high gently
To caress the Earth

9 January 2007

Short Cinema Slam
Movies made by local folk
Besting Hollywood

10 January 2007

Into the sunset
Day goes quietly to bed
While Night takes it's hold

11 January 2007

Off to Sirius
Dear Robert Anton Wilson.
Can you see the Fnords?

12 January 2007

Shoe canvas worn thin
A tiny toe tries escape
Little pig can't go

13 Janaury 2007

Seeds become flowers
Blowing in a cool spring field
Dancing to the wind

14 January 2007

Cold black ice falling
Tiny bits of dust incandesce
Streaking through the sky

15 January 2007

Crystaline tree limbs
Tinkle as the wind sways them
Dropping jewels of ice

16 January 2007

Dark infinite pools
A glimmer of light within
Pierces deep your soul

17 January 2007

A missing dongle
Keeps the intarwebs away
Saddening Deejoe

18 January 2007

Scintillating tubes
Calling out to travelers
"Your turn was back there"

19 January 2007

Gliding on the bridge
The bus turns east to the sun
And faces the dawn

20 January 2007

Behold! The eastern sky
Glows with the lights of Detroit
Poisoning the stars

21 January 2007

I am Yellow Cake
Sweet of Sweets. Look upon my
Frosting and dispair 

22 January 2007

Boxes hold many things
None of them hold the wires
For my phonograph

23 January 2007

The in-head concert
Music floating through my brain
A song on repeat

24 January 2007

Concrete barrier
Tree pushes and bends to you
Someday you will yield 

25 January 2007

Carpet fuzz gathers
Mount an assault on the hall
The vacuum triumps!

26 January 2007

Nature's miracle
Hard kernels become airy
Popcorn, I love you

27 January 2007

Sleepy brain gone dull
This latte is not helping
Hate meta haiku

28 January 2007

Sad alternator
My car's battery goes dull
When you don't fill it

29 January 2007

A hail of bullets
Nerf pellets shoot through the room
I fear an arms race

30 January 2007

Cold falls from on high
Six arms dance in frigid wind
Breathe and they vanish

31 January 2007

Firefox won't die
Hate processes that are dead
And yet still alive

1 February 2007

Kitchen guardian
The gnome looks down from on high
Guarding my popcorn

2 February 2007

Lines in the carpet
Fun with the vacuum cleaner
It does suck that much

3 February 2007 

The brisk wind blows bright
Clouds of snow across the ground;
The sun laughs up high.

4 February 2007

Hey AATA
Why does the seven not go
Past me on Sundays?

5 February 2007

Hot water bottle
Keeping my wee toes toasty
Happiness cocoon

6 February 2007 

A good music store
Narrow aisles, pure chaos
Condensed paradise

7 February 2007

In the Winter's gasp
The sigh of Spring can be heard
Low, breathy, distant.

8 February 2007

Fiery, wirey snake
Glowing darkly in a pit
Barely tame fire

9 February 2007

Late night search for food
Two places did betray us
The last one saved us

10 February 2007

A thread pulls free
Escaping my sweater's grasp
Run free, little string!

11 February 2007

Save us Rocket Dog!
Drive away the evil cats
Give the dog a bone

12 February 2007

Behold the closet!
Full of junk I should clean up
Close the door; ignore.

13 February 2007

Box of dusty books
A piece of paper slips out
Old letter, once lost.

14 February 2007

The French press broken
Shattered glass and tea leaves fall
Third one in a month

15 February 2007

Malestrom of hot air
Glowing, spinning, dark red pit
From it comes popcorn

16 February 2007

Mail flows to Paris
The French host is corrected
service-fr2

17 February 2007

Toes frozen for peace
I search for new shoes in vain
Can order Monday

18 February 2007

A cave of blankets
The cruel world outside my bed
I snug in for warmth.

19 February 2007

Rooibos brewing
And dinner is resting well
Reading beakons me.

20 February 2007

The sun earlier
Breaks into the morning sky
Fuck I need some tea 

21 February 2007

The car, it won't start
Stray lights leave battery sad
Cripes, I hate driving

22 February 2007

Two evening coffees
Disrupting the sleep patterns
Denying slumber

23 February 2007

Behold the Cheese Plate!
Armadillo of crackers
Dinner most sublime

24 February 2007

Map delineates
The paths on which I should bike
Blazing across town

25 February 2007

A snowy drive out
Picking up a new bike frame
A good 10 bucks spent

26 February 2007

Turn around record
Spinning about your axis
Groovy music grooves

27 February 2007

Time stops suddenly
The stars burst brightly before
Falling to madness

28 February 2007

I hear the train come
Around the bend; Not seen sun
Since I don't know when.

1 March 2007

To the Place of Hats!
I need a mitre, toot sweet
Why don't you have them?

2 March 2007

To the Elbow Room
Music from four bands playing
A relaxing night

3 March 2007

A power struggle
Laptop lacking in energy
And no outlets near

4 March 2007

Turning, gnashing gears
Grinding, tearing through metal
My beans are opened.

5 March 2007

Sleepy slumber tire
Stumble awake clock ire
Set all on fire

6 March 2007

My kitchen needs swept
My popcorn popper spraying
Does not help matters

7 March 2007

All that could be solved
Given a spherical cow
The mind just boggles

8 March 2007

Swirling down the drain
The water from dishes flees
And plates grow shiny

9 March 2007

A package of books
New delights come by the post
A P.O. Box gift

10 March 2007

Flow away winter
Your snow drains to the river
Rest until next time

11 March 2007

Late coffee foiled
First the Mug closes at nine
Then a machine dies

12 March 2007

Shake vigorously
My television commands
Else it does not work

13 March 2007

Walk along, evening
Amble as the streets grow dark
Fade away, fair sun.

14 March 2007

Window shades graceful-
ly dance as the cool night breeze
Comes in the window

15 March 2007

I need beans, real quick
A source of iron, they say
I lack energy

16 March 2007

In the back, hipsters
Arguing about honey
Creating a buzz

17 March 2007

Big Pimpin' spending Gs
Big Pimpin' P I M P
Big Pimpin' spending Gs

18 March 2007

In my living room
Books strewn across the table
Debris of my mind

19 March 2007

Shopping carts rattle
I offer my groceries
Beep, goes the scanner

20 March 2007

Cake, I love you, cake
Soft, with frosting, on my plate
Eat before it's late

21 March 2007

Ambulate around
The apartment parking lot
A ten minute walk

22 March 2007

Flashing silver arc
A squawk, a splash, a landing
Geese out on the pond

23 March 2007

In Legless Valley
The One Legged Ass-Kicker
Rules as if a king

24 March 2007

Royal Oak Journey
Amble, buy books, drink coffee
Dinner with Shadow

25 March 2007

Trees whisper nightly
The secrets of the soil
If you just listen

26 March 2007

First ride of the year
Down the block, sending some mail
It's been far too long

27 March 2007

Far off in the night
Sirens scream as they race by
To the hospital

28 March 2007

A wall-hugging pod
Glowing green, lurking softly
Charging batteries

29 March 2007

Cold, bitter journey
The photon jumps through space and
Twinkles in your eye

30 March 2007

Uniqname upgrade
The only thing we have to 
Fear is fear itself.

31 March 2007

In the 'Mug bathroom
Noam Chomsky watches me pee
I'm a bit creeped out

1 April 2007

Ypsilanti streets
Growing quiet in the night
The city's dull roar

2 April 2007

Early to bed, say?
I tried that, now I'm awake
It's 10, not sleepy

3 April 2007

Sitting by the pond
I see geese jump and take flight
Into the night sky

4 April 2007

At my apartment
The water laps at old trees
Dripping with green moss

5 April 2007

Brushing by green grass
The snow whirls in the wind.
Spring pauses for now.

6 April 2007

Generator roars
A puff of black smoke rises
Load testing at MACC

7 April 2007

A Saturday night
Staring at dumps for hours
Not those dumps, sicko.

8 April 2007

Sunday afternoon
Vacuuming the living room
This vac really sucks

9 April 2007

Yerba mate drink
On the third steep in my press
Cool emerald green

10 April 2007

My cell phone locked up
Asking for a PUK
For a second time

11 April 2007

Leaving on a jet
Tomorrow in the morning
Going to Des Moines

12 April 2007

Airlines suck goat ass
Randomly canceling flights
Now I sit and wait

13 April 2007

Flashing by my eyes
Twenty-four frames per second
Still becomes active

14 April 2007

Tearing up the floor
Dancing at my friends wedding
Now I want more cake

15 April 2007

Monterey stuffing
Whenever I visit there
I eat way too much

16 April 2007

High up in the clouds
A place where birds can not go
The sun beams brightly

17 April 2007

Looming high above
Stacks of pans, precarious
Danger when I cook

18 April 2007 

A cat placidly
Saunters past a line of cars
Sniffing the tires

19 April 2007

Ride to Ugly Mug
On a beautiful evening
The bus takes me home

20 April 2007

Bicycle to work
Coming home is easier
Since it is downhill

21 April 2007

I think of Bob Ross
On Saturday afternoons
Happy litle trees

22 April 2007

Caressing my face
The spring breeze brushes past me
Racing to the sky 

23 April 2007

A weeks cooking turns
Into leftover dinner
Bits of this and that

24 April 2007

I need bookcases
I consult the internet
It knows where they are

25 April 2007

I am bored tonight
So I drink tea at the mug
Take that, stupid sleep

26 April 2007

Oh Thursday Thursday
A yabba yabba blursday
Okay, that's enough.

27 April 2007

All of the hotties
Here at the Mug are smokers.
This makes me feel sad.

28 April 2007

Ducks chase each other
As the Huron flows by them
I watch from a bench

29 April 2007

A leaf whirlpools down
An iron storm drain grating
Water gurgles by

30 April 2007

Crabapple blossoms
Tempt me with a sweet fragrance
As I head from work

1 May 2007

Throw off your shackles!
Workers of the world, unite!
Or something like that

2 May 2007

"The RAID caught fire"
I didn't do it, I swear
It's pretty cool, though

3 May 2007

The nail makes a stand
Where wood is rotting away
Yet rust may still win

4 May 2007

Give a talk next week
Perhaps I should finish it
For this, I need tea.

5 May 2007

A2 Alleycat
I ride over to help out
A grand day outside

6 May 2007

Oh no, a sock hole
The toes will make their escape
Heels will be revealed

7 May 2007

The pencil slashes
Making a note that dashes
The hope of millions

8 May 2007

Ethiopian
Food tasted for the first time
Mmm, gomen kitfo 

9 May 2007

A thousand dollar
Dinner bill at Oak City
I had Mac and Cheese

10 May 2007

S & E Left Coast
I finally meet people
I've talked to for years

11 May 2007

Plates of crepes dancing
In the city the sun shines
Filling me with light

12 May 2007

Cities travel by
Sparkles of light in the night
A bump, and I'm home

13 May 2007

My car dead again
Maybe I should let it rot
And give up driving

14 May 2007

Grainy bus vision
Advertising makes sight bleak
On the bus ride home

15 May 2007

New Giants album
The first part is a bit slow
But the end kicks ass

16 May 2007

Morning tea leaves foam
On the inside of the press
Abstract sea portrait

17 May 2007

A blog visitor
Dinner and conversation
Must do it again

18 May 2007

The light at the end
Of the trail is a cop car.
We pass in the night.

19 May 2007

I'm out of Britcoms
I'll have to wait for some more
Are you free, Netflix?

20 May 2007

Nearly six months here
Bedrooms still full of boxes
I must unpack books.

21 May 2007

The leafblower can.
Who can make some awful noise?
The leafblower can.

22 May 2007

Presently the moon
Rises over the dark land
Casting silver rays

23 May 2007

A harsh wail cries out
And screaming, racing away
Goes the ambulance

24 May 2007 

Soft pillow beckons
Calling me to deep slumber
Whispering sweet dreams

25 May 2007

Skittering away
A spilt newspaper escapes
Breeze bringing freedom

26 May 2007

A box spills over
Books fall, crushing my poor toe
I spit out an oath

27 May 2007

The couch whispering
"A nap would be so nice now"
I nod, and agree

28 May 2007

Ducks playing downstream
While geese look on placidly
At Riverside Park

29 May 2007

Sweep the counter clean
Make room for new groceries
Then put them away

30 May 2007

The alternator
Coils spinning in their fields
Electricity

31 May 2007

Leafy green treetops
Poking above the bus stop
Shading the riders

1 June 2007

The cross walk fails me
I stand, pushing the button
But I can not pass

2 June 2007

In north Ann Arbor
The Hill of Death before me
The skies open up

3 June 2007

Couscous: miracle
Tiny pasta becoming
A tasty delight

4 June 2007

At the Bluish Barn
An evening of craftyness
There was bread pudding

5 June 2007

Water is falling
Misting from the skies above
All Nature is damp

6 June 2007

A trip tomorrow
Means running around today
In preparation

7 June 2007

Minneapolis
A long journey by train ends
By a great river

8 June 2007

Duluth by the lake
Nestled along a hillside
Your arms around me

9 June 2007

Along Tischer Creek
Samantha and Kyle wed
Later Freebird plays

10 June 2007

Toes frozen at the
Shore of Lake Superior
As Sarah shows off

11 June 2007

A mournful whistle
I roll into Ann Arbor
And wave to the train

12 June 2007

Along the sidewalk
Tracks across a muddy path
Grass struggles to grow

13 June 2007

Down the road from me
A field of cat-o-nine-tails
Strange rustling within

14 June 2007

Corny miracle
That so little becomes a
Mushroom polenta

15 Jun 2007

The weekend beckons
There are many things to do
But slothfulness reigns

16 June 2007

A fan's droning sound
The afternoon lullaby
As I take a nap

17 June 2007

A bit of scrubbing
A clean bike is happier
And it's shiny, too

18 June 2007

Good bye Punk Planet
Your magazine was good stuff
It will leave a hole

19 Jun 2007

The evening ride home
Drops off a few blocks from home
A short walk ensues

20 June 2007

AFS backups
I need to do them again
Much thinking ahead

21 June 2007 

Chatting on the bus
As Ypsilanti goes by
On a summer day

22 June 2007

Show at the Elbow
Minor Planets rocking out
A CD is bought

23 June 2007

Vroom! Goes the vacuum
Sucking up carpet debris
And leaving fine tracks

24 June 2007

Powerlines above
Electromagnetic dance
Keeping the lights on 

25 June 2007 

Kittenpalooza
Advertised as I bus by
I giggle inside

26 June 2007

Backups whizzing by
As rsync transfers data
I have warm fuzzies

27 June 2007

A perfect spiral
Phi: the golden ratio
Fibbonaci sum

28 June 2007

The drone of the fan
Muffles my laptop's music
Crank Stereolab

29 June 2007

Fractured rear mirror
Shows not where I am going
But where I have been

30 June 2007

At my apartment
A bird hopping through the mud
Where new grass will grow

1 July 2007

What book should I read
A stack of them looms nearby
I pick at random

2 July 2007

A box of flowers
Petals blowing in the wind
A bee buzzes near

3 July 2007

The sun beaming down
Warms the ground that lies below
And thus, the lawn grows

4 July 2007

The pea salad looms
Bright in my mind; In the fridge
Tempting me to eat

5 July 2007

Shaky table hate
You're making it hard to type
And you spill my tea

6 July 2007

An evening well spent
A long letter to a friend
And a box of zines 

7 July 2007

The race of sevens
I serve as the Greed checkpoint
Out on Stadium

8 July 2007

Oh my sweet A/C
I hug your chilly carpace
And hear your sweet drone

9 July 2007

A new bike beckons
On the Croque Monsieur I zoom
Through Ypsilanti

10 July 2007

Paper leaves on stems
Hanging down from the ceiling
Dangling from a string

11 July 2007

Inside a machine
Data is bouncing around
Becomes creative

12 July 2007

Jeremy slighted
A zine with two front pages
Sadness in the mail

13 July 2007

A candle flickers
Causing little things to dance
As distant giants

14 July 2007

"Let me greet the day"
Says the Sun as it sholders
Through the horizon

15 July 2007

Is the word in there?
Is it in your hallowed list,
O Dictionary?

16 July 2007

They Might Be Giants
I'm playing their album Flood
And feel strangely sad

17 July 2007

Sleepy comes early
I want to read 'till Midnight
But I go to Nod

18 July 2007

Thanks nice bus lady
You saw me walking and stopped
To let me get on

19 July 2007

Ypsilanti walk
Exploring new neighborhoods
And enjoying life

20 July 2007

The Bizarre Bazaar
A zombie in a black dress
Demands a haiku

21 July 2007

I hate morning calls
Waking me up from slumber
Telling me bad news

22 July 2007

The dishes are done
Laundry clean, groceries got
I sit back and rest

23 July 2007

I am a tea pot
Here's my handle, here's my spout
When done, tip and pour

24 July 2007

No more hospital
The nurses, tired of Dad
Made him go away

25 July 2007

I'm hanging out at
The Secretary of State
And feel like Kafka

26 July 2007

In the southern sky
Flashes of light arc across
The clouds above them

27 July 2007

With a dark rumble
The skies above open up
And drench us with rain

28 July 2007

I have a new lamp
It's casting a golden glow
In my living room

29 July 2007

The drone of the fan
Lulls me from my book to sleep
As the day grows dim

30 July 2007

Flicker, then darkness
A few clicks bring back the light
My lamp needs some work

31 July 2007

Water and pressure
Against which the beans must yield
Releasing dark gold

1 August 2007

I'm told "Eat more Kale"
Who can deny a sticker?
Plus, kale is tasty

2 August 2007

A late night idea
Begats a flurry of work
Sleep is for the weak

3 August 2007

Crappiest scissors
Making cutting difficult
Cramping up my hand

4 August 2007

I wake up early
A rare thing during weekends
I got a lot done

5 August 2007

Cleaning and cooking
Laundry done and put away
Domestic today

6 August 2007

As I wander home
An ambulance races by
Siren screaming loud

7 August 2007

Chocolate craving
In my mind all afternoon
I buy some candy

8 August 2007

Down the long hallway
A box sitting with my mail
Unlock with a key

9 August 2007

The sky flickering
As rain falls to wet the ground
Washing clean the Earth

10 August 2007

Sparkllng and shiny
The muffin case at the Mug
When the day closes

11 August 2007

Sunlight filtering
Through blinds in my living room
Shows dust in the air

12 August 2007

With a roar it wakes
Belching fumes black to the sky
Now the bus can go

13 August 2007

The thread descending
As a spider builds a home
Twisting in the wind

14 August 2007

Slots in abundance
My tapes have a lot of room
No more crowding here

15 August 2007

On a blade of grass
An ant struggles to the top
The grass sways; ant falls.

16 August 2007

Yarn intertwining
Zigging and zagging around
A blanket for warmth

17 August 2007

Along the Huron
Children laughing with delight
Running with candy

18 August 2007

Delightful taffy
Pull into long sticky threads
Or thwack! to shatter

19 August 2007

Rain runs down my neck
Into the co-op, reprise
Dreary day passing

20 August 2007

In Centrella Land
A new spawn is among us
The end times are nigh

21 August 2007

Bold thunder above
Smashes down upon the Earth
The sky is all grey

22 August 2007

Floating down the street
Fragrance of roasting coffee
Fills my mind with joy

23 August 2007

Looking on the lawn
A Madonna in the park
Serene gaze in stone

24 August 2007

Nature sweeps on through
While first we cower in fear
Later we marvel

25 August 2007 

Along the Huron
Is an island, small and green
There lives the Smeet Frog

26 August 2007

Shining in my eyes
A bright yellow ball of light
Sits low in the sky

27 August 2007 

Chelsea, sweet Chelsea
Whispers the train going by
Chelsea, sweet Chelsea 

28 August 2007

Jesus looks from on high
Watching me drinking my tea
A shelf on the wall

29 August 2007

A dead bug hanging
From a thread on my windshield
How did it get there?

30 August 2007

Grape Nuts and Yogurt
I'm trying to bike to work
They want to kill me

31 August 2007

Blocking the napkins
Lady sweetning espresso
Like I'm just not there

1 September 2007

Nearly a year past
I filled a pod with much junk
And now it is back

2 September 2007

Cool September morn
Cyclists ride through the country
Legs moving them far

3 September 2007

Here comes Billy Jack
Doing what has to be done
Hope, where others fail

4 September 2007

A cup, a plate, spoon
You have served my dinner well
Rest now in the sink

5 September 2007

I hate you, alarm
Sonic scream searing slumber
Ruins my good dreams

6 September 2007

Run! For the bus comes
Down the avenue quickly
Pause, and it is gone

7 September 2007

Who keeps the blanket?
Where is it when I'm away?
Lying on my couch.

8 September 2007

The crunch of gravel
Quiet in the morning light
A path to nowhere

9 September 2007

At the light of dawn
The new day stirs, waking up
Quiet grows busy

10 September 2007

One calm, one fury
At the Freedom School they meet
Strong against the town

11 September 2007

A zephyr stiring
Dances past my window shades
Clatter in the wind

12 September 2007

Tape library sad
It can seek but it can't grab
IBM fixes

13 September 2007

"Seek the K-Mart sign
That will get you to my place,"
I tell Mom and Dad

14 September 2007

Water flowing on
Passes by a mill making
True Apple Cider

15 September 2007

Sitting on a hill
Behold our mighty tower
It gives us water

16 September 2007

Mom and Dad have left
On to Canada they go
While I do laundry

17 September 2007

Stay calm, Billy Jack
To find your true inner self
Seek the Fourth Level

18 September 2007

I should buy a bed
My couch has served well these years
But I'm getting old

19 September 2007

Potato! Sublime!
O, what mealy love you hide.
Crisp skin, soft inside

20 September 2007

My tire was sad
And I was late getting up
It has been that week

21 September 2007

With a bluish glow
A lamp illuminates me
Guarding my table

22 September 2007

As I am walking
Someone calls me Dumbledore
I'm weirdly happy

23 September 2007

The sound of Autumn
Crunching leaves beneith my bike
Trees slowly sleeping

24 September 2007

Mine eyes have seen the
Glory of the coming of
Billy Jack's Fury

25 September 2007

Sprinklers on wet grass
Spray me waiting for the bus
And making no sense

26 September 2007

It's morning again
And bus riders dodge traffic
In Ypsilanti

27 September 2007

Tangy vinegar
Transforms the mundane
Into pickle joy

28 September 2007

Another Friday
The weekend looming head
I leave work early

29 September 2007

Spinning fire orbs
Describe an arc in the night
Whirling and twirling

30 September 2007

I can remember
Thirty days hath September
The rest eludes me

1 October 2007

Wash away the lights
Rain in streaks and in puddles
Falling from the sky

2 October 2007

Grey people walking
Walking, leaving no path
I am one of them

3 October 2007

My addiction hard
A few days without caffiene
Hurting my poor head

4 October 2007

My clock glows, and in
Glowing reminds me that I'm
Awake at this time

5 October 2007

A night of good sleep
I'm so glad you have returned
And made me happy.

6 October 2007

It's morning again
In Ypsilanti, and sane
People make some tea

7 October 2007

It's evening again
In Ypsilanti, and sane
People eat popcorn

8 October 2007

Squares alternating
Royalty safely behind
While pawns dance out front

9 October 2007

Glistening bottle
A syrup full of flavor
Tasty on waffles

10 October 2007

A monolith forms
With an evil robot mind
And hard, grippy arms

11 October 2007

Lyrical gangster
Ripping beats like year old sheets
My rhymes can't compete

12 October 2007

Grey cotton blankets
Spreading across a cool sky
Covering the Earth

13 October 2007

Of my pocket calc
I am the operator
Adding, subtracting

14 October 2007

A mess of wires
Tangled, messy, in a box
Twisting what I need

15 October 2007

Errand forgotten
I need a trip to the store
To buy some stickers

16 October 2007

Mathematical
Logarithm describes a 
Curve asymptotic

17 October 2007

Waters whisper low
Quietly greeting small rocks
As they pass on by

18 October 2007

Flexible tubing
Bright orange in color, bumpy
I trip over you

19 October 2007

A strand of fine glass
Lit through with coherent light
Speed of light info

20 October 2007

In the afternoon
Barking filters through the air
Dogs enjoy the day

21 October 2007

Outside my window
Bushes rustle in the wind
As trees shed their leaves

22 October 2007

Warming up some soup
I see I'm out of crackers
And I curse the Gods

23 October 2007

Reload. Click. Reload.
Why am I reloading this?
OKCupid hate.

24 October 2007

I love cold weather
And making a warm bundle
Strong against nature

25 October 2007

A thick envelope
There's nothing better than mail
To cheer oneself up

26 October 2007

The bearded lady
Keeping the sound optimal
And the bands in line

27 October 2007

Asphyxiation
Dreaded blood in glassy eggs
One more Ypsi night

28 October 2007

The magic of rice
Hard kernels transformed to soft
By heat and water

29 October 2007

I think I'll stop at
One impossible problem
Solved each day at work

30 October 2007

The eggstacle course
Bike this egg around the square
And do not break it

31 October 2007

Candy night tonight
Apparently. I'm having
Tea at Ugly Mug

1 November 2007

A pile of leaves
Crunches as I leave the bus
Becomming as dust

2 November 2007

Frost blankets the ground
As Ypsilanti awakes
Leaving a cold bed

3 November 2007

Give me crackers, some cheese,
And a bit of fruit to eat
Simple meal delight

4 November 2007

Urbana - Champaign
At UIUC I am
Talking TSM

5 November 2007

Walking for miles
I explore a new city
And seek what it hides

6 November 2007

When no one watches
I quickly dance a polka
Smiling to myself

7 November 2007

Why do you hate me
my stomach? You gurgle and
Fill me with much dread

8 November 2007

Tiny flakes of snow
They are but few, yet signal
The millions to come

9 November 2007

Cold is conforting
It wakes me, cuts to my core
Makes me feel alive

10 November 2007

Do you see the light?
I do, and am putting the
Band back together

11 November 2007

Note to all my socks:
Where in the world did you go?
Please come back to me.

12 November 2007

Beautiful Devine
How could I have lived this long
Without seeing you?

13 November 2007 

Morning, my hatred
Burns for you as a red sun
Destroying all life

14 November 2007

They Might Be Giants
Fill Michigan Theater
With music and joy

15 November 2007

First the sun, now sleet
Clear to cloudy the sky grows
In the evening, snow

16 November 2007

Yellowed newspaper
Falling out of an old book
Brings back memories

17 November 2007

I awake to dogs
Disturbing my deep slumber
Poisoning my dreams

18 November 2007

I'm riding alone
With the Huron as my guide
Moon smiling above

19 November 2007

Whipple is no more
The last rolls are unguarded
Who will chide squeezers?

20 November 2007

To Radulovich
You stood where others withered
Strong in your beliefs

21 November 2007

Going all over
I can't find that which I want
It is annoying

22 November 2007

On the day I should
I did not take any naps
Must need tryptophane

23 November 2007

My fingers freezing
Gloves that are just half fingers
Not good for winter

24 November 2007

The bookcase empty
Standing, waiting, such promise
To fill is a joy

25 November 2007

From the sky on high
Flakes of water, falling soft
Coat the ground with white

26 November 2007

Carmelized onion
A hidden treasure layer
I love my crock pot

27 November 2007

Twinkle twinkle start
High upon the far tower
Shine down upon us

28 November 2007

Windows rimed with frost
Open to another world 
Dancing with snowflakes

29 November 2007

A child sliding
Playing on an ice puddle
Brings back memories

30 November 2007

I shall lose disks now
I won't go quietly, says
adsmone

1 December 2007

The bright dark sky shines
With the light of the city
Glowing through the snow

2 December 2007

Annoying puddles
Rain collects where it should not
Thanks stupid landlord

3 December 2007

Oh my dear crockpot
Serving another tasty
I awake to you

4 December 2007

The joy of a book
As I lay curled in bed
Pages unfolding

5 December 2007

A warm breath suffers
The air to become cloudy
A fog floats away

6 December 2007

In the morning light
I gaze at the sky and squint
Asking why I'm up

7 December 2007

Why do brain dumps fail?
The packet length is too long.
Why does that happen?

8 December 2007

Sweaters equal love
New ones found at a thrift store
Making me feel warm

9 December 2007

A lesson I've learned:
Espresso makes me mighty
At fixing weird code

10 December 2007

The love in bagels
So simple, pure and sublime
Round, holey beauty

11 December 2007

A spark from heaven
Glinting in the cold night sky
Falls and quickly fades

12 December 2007

A ribbon of light
Slithering, halting, honking
Going nowhere fast

13 December 2007

As electrons dance
The world becomes glowing red
My bagel, toasted

14 December 2007

Too much junk, I say
Next year shall be clean out year
Well, I say that now

15 December 2007

In microcosms
The small grows into fullness
Large, unknowable

16 December 2007

Awake to a world
Covered in inches of snow
Too fluffy to pack

17 December 2007

The feel of paper
Smooth, in anticipation
For thoughts to come out

18 December 2007

Four stories of books
Only an hour from me
I must not go there

19 December 2007

Smoke from a chimney
Curls into the night air
Far above my head

20 December 2007

Walking I notice
A leaf dancing before me
Its tree forgotten

21 December 2007

With a hurried rush
Errands all over the place
Before I take off

22 December 2007

Tonight I am an
Amtrak Distressed Passenger
Stuck in Chicago

23 December 2007

Stuck in Mount Pleasant
Until the snow at home stops
And my parents come

24 December 2007

Howling snow and wind
Part, causing the sky to clear
I end my journey

25 December 2007

Those four deviled eggs
Delicious, but I should have
Let those last five be

26 December 2007

All day marathon
Of Mythbusters episodes
I veg out today

27 December 2007

The tunnel finished
The drift conquered, the well switch
Is now reachable

28 December 2007

Leaving Chicago
On a bus to Ann Arbor
Finally I'm home

29 December 2007

A week of travel
Drains me; Some quiet hours
at the Mug refresh

30 December 2007

Energy today
Up early, and productive
What is wrong with me?

31 December 2007

Should something something
I don't remember that song
Who really sings it?

1 January 2008

Snow thickly covers
And sound across the city
Is muffled and dull

2 January 2008

A frigid blast wakes
Waking me from my doldrums
As I'm leaving work

3 January 2008

Snow crunches, I walk
The bus rumbles as it goes
And I seek coffee

4 January 2008

A picture, frozen
Thaws out memories once lost
Washing me away

5 January 2008

Candle, burning bright
Standing strong against the night
Holding back the cold

6 January 2008

Pressure of the deep
Eons pass, and the darkness
Turning dirt to gems

7 January 2008

Wefting warping threads
Knotting and twisting become
The scarf that warms me

8 January 2008

The stuff of beaches
Suffered through an inferno
Makes my water glass

9 January 2008

Down with the atoms
Photons and electrons move
Defining our world

10 January 2008

Numbers infinite
Equations unlimited
Mathematical

11 January 2008

The apartment above
Must have a large pack of dogs
Ceaselessly running

12 January 2008

Potato, my potato
Fluffy, steamy, you split open
And become devine

13 January 2008

The rain at Elbel
Muting the sound of the game
Skids becoming goals

14 January 2008

Philosophical
My thoughts grow less topical
These words stalk you all

15 January 2008

Lyrical calming
Frozen brainstem enbalming
Slight-of-hand palming

16 January 2008

The lonesome whistle
Drifts across the snowy land
Tugging my heart home

17 January 2008

I love pineapple
Although I used to hate it
When I was little

18 January 2008

Old bricks stand exposed
Steel beams arching overhead
My coffee grows cold

19 January 2008

A giant bestrides
The hill where water goes high.
Stony, silent, cold

20 January 2008

A crystal of ice
Bouncing in the atmosphere
Dancing in the wind

21 January 2008

Consumed by info
The brain escapes far away
To a happy place 

22 January 2008

A river of ice
Born beneath a thousand feet
Slithers in the snow

23 January 2008

The light, grey and pink
Filters through the snow falling
Glowing in the dark

24 January 2008

The city in the dark
The close streets comforting me
I walk through the night

25 January 2008

Ideas in my head
Concepts bouncing all around
Words flowing freely

26 January 2008

Do you see the Sun?
Easing into the new day
Racing through the sky

27 January 2008

Howling, the wind screams
Filling my heart with madness
As I try to sleep

28 January 2008

A'choo explosion
Blasting open the quiet
I sniffle at work

29 January 2008

As macaroni falls
I curse myself and all life
Sigh, and start to sweep

30 January 2008

A hot, murky depth
From which rises hard metal
I rinse silverware 

31 January 2008

Pillow, o pillow!
Your sweet embrace holds my head
You soften the night

1 February 2008

Snow falls, covering
The land in crisp blinding light
Quickly ground to mud

2 February 2008

Elbow of morning
Jabbing into sleep's sore ribs
Bruising, unforgiving

3 February 2008

I spill, water falls
A rush to clear the table
Paper thrown asunder

4 February 2008

'Twas night in Ypsi
And dancing through my head was
Visions of pointers

5 February 2008

Rain drips in puddles
Causing snow to melt away
A glimmer of spring

6 February 2008

Awash in a light glow
Ypsilanti before me
As I wander home

7 February 2008

Walk the circumference
With a diameter guide
The ratio pi

8 February 2008

Nothing has power
If you take away zero
Mathematics hurts

9 February 2008

Friends with everyone
Benford has a law for it
One, identity

10 February 2008

My mind pondering
A square root that bends numbers
Imaginary

11 February 2008

The natural base
Springing from logarithms
Fine identity

12 February 2008

What happens, I ask,
If I put some m-n-ms 
Into my blender

13 February 2008

A thin veiny leaf
Dancing in the bitter wind
Harkens things to come

14 February 2008

The world upside down
The ceiling becomes the floor
In my little world

15 February 2008

In a perfect world
Days would be fourty hours
I would take long naps

16 February 2008

Standing in the cold
Bikers arrive, I send them
Off to Ambrosia

17 February 2008

The dripping of rain
Is a sign of spring to come
Each drop is new life

18 February 2008

I walk out of work
And the sun is still shining
What is that bright thing?

19 February 2008

Cold. Cold cold cold cold.
Cold cold cold. Cold. Cold cold cold.
Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold. Cold.

20 February 2008

The brush, growing damp
Is covered with a cold paste
That scrubs my teeth clean

21 February 2008

Down to the laundry
Slide card load clothes add some soap
Whirl and they're clean

22 February 2008

The table wobbling
Sends my tea stumbling, spilling
Damp napkin, spirt 

23 February 2008

Potholes blossoming
Like mushrooms from all the roads
Except not tasty

24 February 2008

Ceaselessly moving
The sun dances through the sky
Day to night to day

25 February 2008

Where does one find a
Blade of grass in this city
Untouched by the snow

26 February 2008

When my brain spins fast
And things start making some sense
I get a bit scared

27 February 2008

An errant pinky
Where metal and metal meet
Jumping and shouting

28 February 2008

Dark cranial caves
Ignored, forgotten. They sulk.
And my head explodes.

29 February 2008

No lords a leaping
But the day is leaping here
And that's all that counts

1 March 2008

Layers of paint hide
Years of time that pass on by
Hidden, locked away

2 March 2008

I am watching pie
And now I am craving pie
Damn you, Alton Brown

3 March 2008 

Benadryl sweet dreams
My aunt is evil and can
Turn night into day

4 March 2008

Technology moves
And what was once a god is
Cast into the pit

5 March 2008

What words, forgotten?
What thoughts gone forever?
What dreams, dim and lost?

6 March 2008

Battery low, sad
Jitterbug electrons now
Dance a slow tempo

7 March 2008

A tiny bright star
Guiding me all the way home
Polaris, my light

8 March 2008

Short and stout teapot
See it there, handle and spout
Tip, and pour it out

9 March 2008

Soup! A Miracle!
Simple but complex. Tasty.
A pot of goodness!

10 March 2008

A lesson I've learned
Six post-midnight espressos
Really fucks your sleep

11 March 2008

The Great Wofflelon
Elder god of clean bath towels
And fuzzy slippers

12 March 2008

Beacon in the sky
On the tower you give light
You say stay away

13 March 2008

Little wall standing strong
Struggling to hold back the earth
A flower pokes through

14 March 2008

Circle ratio
Irrational, transcendent-
al, easy as pi.

15 March 2008

Though the winds may blow
A fair spring day in my head
Sunshine and cloudless

16 March 2008

Yarn tightly twisted
Woven into a warm scarf
Flapping in the wind

17 March 2008

The paint peeling off
Reveals bricks from long ago
And layers of time

18 March 2008

Off to Jupiter
And Beyond the Infinite
Good night, A. C. Clarke

19 March 2008

The disk to mirror
Has been dead since who knows when.
Shabby: suck acme.

20 March 2008

Spring in Michigan
One brief day of nice weather
Then tomorrow: snow

21 March 2008

Thick and stifleing
Snow falls from the sky above
Piling on the ground

22 March 2008 

The snow is melting
Rivulets become rivers
How lovely the splash

23 March 2008

In the sky a kite
Struggling, wanting a new life
Straining to break free

24 March 2008

Swiftly falling rock
Rolling, skipping, of the cliff
Flying to a splash

25 March 2008

Seed laying dormant
Waiting for the right moment
Springing into life

26 March 2008

A robin flutters
Along the branches of a tree
I'm longing for Spring

27 March 2008

Pillow, softly sit
On the couch blankets pile
Warm, comfy sleep time

28 March 2008

The leaf that quenches
Hot or cold, a tasty treat
Tea: drink of the gods

29 March 2008

Parking lot biking
Testing out a new cycle
It hasn't broke yet

30 March 2008

The parking garage
Rings with the sound of polo
Watch your head, its short

31 March 2008

Thunder rolling through
Gentle rain falling softly
The Earth waking up

1 April 2008

People are morons
Even more so on this day
Why must they do this?

2 April 2008

Will tulips yet grow?
As the ground is warming up,
And the worms dancing

3 April 2008

Deep below, lava
Churns and stirs, rising, falling
Fires in the deep

4 April 2008

Wandering orbits
Comets dancing in the sky
Looping through cold space

5 April 2008

Corner Brewery 
Alive, the sounds of banjos
Funds for the Freighthouse

6 April 2008

Famished, exhausted
Scarfing down a bit sandwich
I'm sleeping early

7 April 2008

The waters bubble
Lapping at Riverside Park
Washing age away

8 April 2008

Tea, you give me life
On this world I could not be
But for this sweet drink

9 April 2008

A serene figure
Looking down from the bookcase
Frozen, ceramic

10 April 2008

Water softly falls
To dampen the street below
Cars zooming along

11 April 2008

The sound of people
Enjoying the weekend's start
Filling me with calm

12 April 2008

An idea forming
Quickly grows, colors blossom
Go forth, laminate

13 April 2008

Bike polo today
I played a couple hours
I'm totally beat

14 April 2008

Wireless laundry
Soapy suds and internet
This is the future

15 April 2008

Why frost? Why why why?
It's the middle of April,
Won't you go away?

16 April 2008

Bibbling bubble
Babbling brook bounces between
Big blunted boulders

17 April 2008

When pigs have been passed
The night flashes red and blue
As Joe runs a light

18 April 2008

The night draws open
A pot of tea is enjoyed
The breeze cools my drink

19 April 2008

The life of a worm
Chewing dirt, making tunnels
Wriggling in the ground

20 April 2008

Brothers Love and Hate
It looks like Hate is on top
Love wins in the end

21 April 2008

Tiny humming sounds
My fridge is staying chilly
It wants me to know

22 April 2008

In the small hours
The world is dark and quiet
And so far away

23 April 2008

Toast, glorious toast
Maillard explains, wires make,
You pop up in need

24 April 2008

A zen frame of mind
Wandering across the new thoughts
Pondering strange forms.

25 April 2008

The bold weekend starts
Laying ahead of me, young
Ready to relax

26 April 2008

A day of bold plans
Gone to a comfy sofa
You steal my gumption

27 April 2008

Mallets don't belong
In some places my dear friends
Like in my front wheel

28 April 2008

A crafty mind thinks
A banner bright in my head
For canvas I seek

29 April 2008

Swirling bubbles swarm
Lifting dirt off of my shirts
Whisking it away

30 April 2008

Tomorrow I move
Thankfully I have a month
Since I've packed nothing

1 May 2008

Pizza with perverts
Where the phrase "snowball fight" takes
A whole new meaning

2 May 2008

Thoughts of bookshelving
Whirling through my puny mind
Ideas flash and fade

3 May 2008

The banner is wrought
Paint and canvas, drying slow
Tomorrow it flies

4 May 2008

In Ypsilanti
Amazing people making
Awesome things happen

5 May 2008

Filling up with stuff
My apartment slowly goes
Into clutterness

6 May 2008

I awake refreshed
The sun shining warm, brightly
And life in the air

7 May 2008

Oh what pain it is
Having a lovely hammock
And only one tree

8 May 2008

Alas the pickle
Dropped on the floor becomes sad
No longer wanted

9 May 2008

With each tick the clock
Discards a second of time
Future, present, past

10 May 2008

The joy in filling
Empty bookcases makes me
Feel glad in my heart

11 May 2008

Time passes slowly
Until I need it to stop
And zooming it goes

12 May 2008

I see the giant
Large, unmoving, and quiet
Before it wanders

13 May 2008

The Shelves of Weird hold
Mysteries from all over
Or junk that I have

14 May 2008

I'm craving a malt
I don't have the gumption to
Get ice cream right now

15 May 2008

Dust, floating slowly
A giant whirlwind moves
It tickles; I sneeze

16 May 2008 

The happiness from
A well made veggie spring roll
Is one of beauty

17 May 2008

Back and forth and back
Hauling crap I should throw out
I should use fire

18 May 2008

Oh back! You hate me.
Hours of lifing stuff has
Really pissed you off.

19 May 2008

"Oh, just for a bit"
At the Corner Brewery
Turns into hours

20 May 2008

Newark, New Jersey
What more could this one say, than
Newark, New Jersey

21 May 2008

In cells I'm roaming
Traipsing across site to site
Meander and look

22 May 2008

Wandering New York
An hour spend searching for
Apple in a cube

23 May 2008

Hoboken I roam
An afternoon getting lost
Then some cheap pizza

24 May 2008

At home I arrive
The journey done, travels gone
Now once more I rest 

25 May 2008

A day of crashes
My bike suffers at polo
And my body too

26 May 2008

Warm still air moves in
Breathing sultry hints of a 
Warm summer to come

27 May 2008

Frost tonight, they say
Perhaps that breathing was just
Summer's labored breath

28 May 2008

My life in boxes
Paths narrowly wandering
Don't unpack, make forts

29 May 2008

The breeze disturbing
The shade over the window
Wakes me up early

30 May 2008

I have made charcoal
I hate cleaning the oven
Can't robots do this?

31 May 2008

Totally done now
Boxes packed, hauled and lifted
And now to unpack

1 June 2008

The pack is heavy
The ride long and exhausting
But the food is good

2 June 2008

Almost did not go
But the show was amazing
The people awesome

3 June 2008

The jacket amiss
The rain pours down and the sky
Thunders in laughter

4 June 2008

My life in mazes
No matter which way I turn
Boxes define paths

5 June 2008

Heat and humidity
Force people to rush inside
Cool lemonade flows

6 June 2008

The wisest one works
Selling us snacks in a train
Smart people listen

7 June 2008

While Twins are losing
The Jordan Keys are returned
And fireworks fly

8 June 2008

The bursting salad
Scalding soup, and bread galore
I ate way too much

9 June 2008 

The places I touch
Infintesimal, compared
To what I pass by

10 June 2008

Drip drop the rain falls
Buses lumber by, splashing
Dry shoes a faint dream

11 June 2008

``Die a soapy death!"
I shout to dirt on my clothes
``You're no match for me."

12 June 2008

Old cars making noise
Shiny metal lines the street
Crowding Depot Town

13 June 2008

Escape from New York
Pain, but I can't look away
I thought you were dead

14 June 2008

Biking through the streets
I pedal until I I'm home
Tired and alive

15 June 2008

A candle glowing
A reminder of the Sun
On a summer's night

16 June 2008

Through lenses of glass
Foggy, scratched and well worn out
I gaze at the world

17 June 2008

We did not start this
There is in fact a whole song
About this fire

18 June 2008

There are schemes afoot
Going all over this town
You must find the clues

19 June 2008

Flow Huron River
Through the city where I live
Your time here is short

20 June 2008

Green the grass growing
The leaves high up in the trees
Fields sway in the breeze

21 June 2008

Who baked the first cake?
How long did it live before
Frosting was first made?

22 June 2008

Frosty glass holding
A tasty chilled beverage
Root beer is for me

23 June 2008

Sinus explosion
Take them out, get rid of them
I do not want them!

24 June 2008

Insomnia blows
My brain racing won't shut up
The sheep are afraid

25 June 2008

Unplanned late laundry
The spin of clothes hypnotic
The smell of clean calms

26 June 2008

Nine hours on the road
Where a radio station
Plays TMBG.

27 June 2008

Downtown Rochester
Jennie and I go for food
I buy a notebook

28 June 2008

Storms are chasing me
Driving across Wisconsin
Mirrors show dark skies.

29 June 2008

Plans are being made
The Depot Town Thunderdome
I hope there are trains

30 June 2008

Evenings well spent there
A corner; my usual
Tea or rooibos

1 July 2008

The land of poutine
There the true north, strong and free
I yearn to return

2 July 2008

``Do you know its name?"
``Beats me, it's a block of wood.
Cheap, and the right size."

3 July 2008

With three bicycles
Why don't I have spare pedals
For the bike without?

4 July 2008

Little kids laughing
Zooming in front of my bike
I swerve to dodge them

5 July 2008

Lazy saturday
I sit around all day long
And get nothing done

6 July 2008

The tile peeling
Revealing layers of time
Flooring from the past

7 July 2008

My broom, you must sweep
Though you may not desire
For you are my broom

8 July 2008

Triangle burning
Aflame in geometry
You turn one-eighty

9 July 2008

A crafty idea
Makes me feel warm and giddy
A sly grin appears

10 July 2008

Gears crushing, blade cuts
Metal is torn asunder
The can is open

11 July 2008

Free Shot Friday's Back
Espresso pulled, I drink it
And am born anew

12 July 2008

Off to the market
Where farmers sell me veggies
I make a salad

13 July 2008

Ride to Ann Arbor
Three hours of bike polo
I feel the way back

14 July 2008

I cleaned my office
Strangely bare, I stare at it
Shocked when I walk in

15 July 2008

Zine folks in A2
On tour, I stop and chat
This makes me happy

16 July 2008

Squishy brakes spraying
Fluid on the ground. I pause
And take the car in

17 July 2008

Sweet insomnia
Up early, hit post office
Coffee at the mug

18 July 2008

With a million jabs
Ink becomes a part of me
Stuck under my skin

19 July 2008

On a dreary day
Five people brave Ypsi's streets
Racing for a prize

20 July 2008

The keys in Ypsi
Do not help me in Chelsea
I swear at myself

21 July 2008

Mangled muddled code
Fills me with desperation
I try to slog through

22 July 2008

A malestrom of suck
Dust flying, meeting its doom
Torn from the carpet

23 July 2008

Pager in the night
Flat tire in the morning
Today was not good

24 July 2008

No one for pizza
I watch cars for a while
Then go to the Mug

25 July 2008

Slick photos staring
Vacant from the magazine
It is recycled

26 July 2008

Mosquitos feeding 
I call out bingo numbers
To bikers racing

27 July 2008

Mallet torn away
Fingers bending suddenly
Skin torn as I fly

28 July 2008

Mealy mouth mumbling
Mornings make me more morose
More morpheus, man

29 July 2008

Algorithms dance
Visions of code in my head
I need better sleep

30 July 2008

I still have boxes
Unpacked, stacked, since my last move
I should burn them all

31 July 2008

A brilliant morning
Out of bed early, coffee
And news at the Mug

1 August 2008

Falling waters hush
The sound of nature living
A rainbow pleases

2 August 2008

Produce brightly sits
The bounty of Nature shown
The market this morn

3 August 2008

Sticker sticker there
Why you stuck upon the chair?
Do you find that fair?

4 August 2008

As August anew
Arranges accordingly
All act axiously

5 August 2008

The current flowing
Lights glowing, the machine wakes
Starts humming; thinking

6 August 2008

Little tiny plums
Drip dropping juice on the ground
The ground takes a drink

7 August 2008

Thursday stretches out
Long, extended, never ends
I'd maim for a nap

8 August 2008

I see a star, bright
Burning with a quiet heat
In the sky so cold

9 August 2008

Streets crumble, skies burn
Whailing and gnashing of teeth
I am out of cheese

10 August 2008

Dancing in my head
Visions of cinnamon rolls
I'm in bed, sighing

11 August 2008

The light blinks, they're off
The morning rush exploding
Traffic on the street

12 August 2008

Peas peas peas I love
Tiny green spheres of pure joy
Plain or in salads

13 August 2008

The bus rushes by
Plants bow in passing as to
An ancient queen

14 August 2008

Soft, quiet humming
Roasting, making beans tasty
The fragrance devine

15 August 2008

A sight to behold
Morning, starting, a new day
Life is glorious

16 August 2008

The night sky explodes
Fireworks at Frog Island
Bright colors, loud sounds

17 August 2008

Seasons are shifting
Days drawing closed earlier
Autumn awaits us

18 August 2008

The whirlygig comes
Gears gnashing spinning maelstrom
The smell of oil

19 August 2008

It is new shoes time
The sole worn, holes pushing through
I must let them go

20 August 2008

Pillow curled tight
Reveals a neck that's scrunched up
Bent, twisted, painful

21 August 2008

A whirling coil
Spins in a magnetic field
Pushing electrons

22 August 2008

The sky sighing soft
Releases warm breath, pausing
Before the rain starts

23 August 2008

Dancing in the air
A spider dangles, twisting
Weaving a fine web

24 August 2008

The pressure holding
Mixing gases and liquids
Makes bubbly water

25 August 2008

Wire, twisted, bent
A flat coil holding tight
Paper stuck within

26 August 2008

Stacks of boxes make
Finding something in a box
A dull painful task

27 August 2008

Apples gone sour
The mother broods murkily
Hiding in the jar

28 August 2008

Shiny steel surrounds
Separate strange screwdrivers
Sitting still, singing

29 August 2008

Oh, the long weekend
Stretched gloriously ahead
Ripe with potential

30 August 2008

I'm lost, wandering
Floors of books spread before me
A grin on my face

31 August 2008

Pizza aftershock
My stomach unhappy as
I start a new day

1 - 6 September 2008

No haiku

7 September 2008

Asleep, the rain starts
A grey day as I awake
Brightens to deep blue

8 September 2008

Leaves falling softly
Growing wet as rain comes down
Fall's foundation starts

9 September 2008

I think of cider
Of apples hanging, juicy
Swaying in the breeze

10 September 2008

Of cooler weather
Getting out sweaters and scarves
And dusting off gloves

11 September 2008

Nights woken by frost
The air crisp, clean, breath fogging
Nose burning with cold

12 September 2008

I know it comes soon
And in time I will hate it
But now, I embrace

13 September 2008

Rain, drenching, falling
Running in streams down the street
Faint rivers, fading

14 September 2008

Rain will not stop us!
There are tacos to be had,
Even if we're damp

15 September 2008

O, blinky light dead!
Rain and grit have destroyed you
Can you be rescued?

16 September 2008

Hunger's a strange pain
Fading in and out, sharp, dull
I should eat dinner

17 September 2008

Planning a long ride
Details take a lot of time
At least there's coffee

18 September 2008

You lost the tape, MACC
I can see it, you scanned it
Why can't you find it?

19 September 2008

Winding to an end
The week reaches Friday
The people rejoice

20 September 2008

Trees prepare to sleep
Evening sun shines, last bright rays
Highlights their colors

21 September 2008

Wheels spinning chain whirrs
Feet pedal a long cycle
Mallet hitting ball

22 September 2008

Simple words: crock pot
Yet from you comes food divine
For good food, add time

23 September 2008

I sing a song: beans!
Glorious simplicity
A meal for the gods

24 September 2008

In your head, lurking
Pressure building in dark caves
Weary, sore, headache

25 September 2008

Robot Ninja fights
Saving the folks of Ridgway
When friends die, he feels

26 September 2008

Debate droning on
Neither filling me with hope
I'm used to it now

27 September 2008

A state of boredom
Nothing sounds interesting
And so on, endless

28 September 2008

Sad socks growing holes
Showing toes, needing mending
Heel unraveling

29 September 2008

Strangely sore I wake
Wondering what I did that
Makes my body gripe

30 September 2008

Doughnut! The word joy
A simple pastry I love
Plain, unassuming

1 October 2008

Autumn comes quickly
In a snap; I rush to close
Windows long open

2 October 2008

Fuzzy through the air
Comes the next vice president
Fun to watch, at least

3 October 2008

Blur at twenty-four
What is stopped becomes motion
And then still again

4 October 2008

Busy worker bee
Buzzing through my apartment
Lots of stuff is done

5 October 2008

Bike polo kicks ass!
Two good games, excellent play
And a ton of fun

6 October 2008

Click, drag, click, drag, click
Repetative editing
Bored out of my mind

7 October 2008

Gritty grains melted
Hot, incandescent, then cool
Becomes clear and smooth

8 October 2008

July tore fingers
October tries to mend them
Now I type funny

9 October 2008

Americano
Take a stack of newspapers
Sit in the corner

10 October 2008

Far whistles blowing
Two trains passing in the night
Want to tell the world

11 October 2008

A race to the end
Random routes in the night time
Cider and doughnuts

12 October 2008

The blur of the day
Stops when you think about it
Who has time for that?

13 October 2008

Doughnut day today?
I'm afraid, did I miss it?
No, it is next week.

14 October 2008

vos dumps are too slow
And I keep losing my creds
localauth fixes

15 October 2008

A fan hums softly
Late in the fall; I wonder
When it goes away

16 October 2008

FD_SETSIZE hate
glibc sucks major ass
I hate you, linux

17 October 2008

Espresso machine
Sitting sadly, not working
Side torn off, naked

18 October 2008

Autumn's bold colors
Captured in a split second
A series of bits

19 October 2008

Corner Brewery
Waiting for the Fall Riders
Enjoying the breeze

20 October 2008

A bagel, perfect
A torus of toasty joy
Wonderful, sublime

21 October 2008

Haven in the dark
Light and warmth full of good smells
A sight to behold

22 October 2008

Frost hides in the shade
And the Sun, seeking it out
Enters dark corners

23 October 2008

Happy stripey socks
Color circles my ankle
Make my feet cheerful

24 October 2008

Holes in my sweater
Need patching before they grow
I must get some thread

25 October 2008

Two trains in the night
A whailing cry, booming sounds
Then silence returns

26 October 2008

A line for cider
Stretches away from the mill
The wait is worth it

27 October 2008

The evening shattered
The howl of a leaf blower
Just use a damn rake

28 October 2008

Handfulls of paper
Stuffed away in old boxes
Bring back memories

29 October 2008

Walking in the dark
Crunching frost under my feet
Refreshing cold air

30 October 2008

Wheeler Park grows dark
A constellation of light
As cyclists race off

31 October 2008

Random anime
And then Army of Darkness
What a fine evening

1 November 2008

Ideas change the world
Just look at the paperclip
Bent wire billions

2 November 2008

A week of nothing
Stretching ahead pointlessly
Resplendent, empty

3 November 2008

Two heavy junk loads
I should throw most of this out
But I keep hauling

4 November 2008

A stroll to the poll
Voting done quick and easy
Now I drink coffee

5 November 2008

Carrier silent
Small lights no longer blinking
Reset DSL

6 November 2008

The smell of crunching
Yellow leaves fall around me
A carpet, fading

7 November 2008

A smokey mist floats
Hugging the ground, dampening
Fleeing from the sun

8 November 2008

The last junk resting
Snug and tight in a new place
When will I return?

9 November 2008

No polo today
But a visitor from far
Some go for coffee

10 November 2008

First snow stuck today
Stuck in corners and ridges
Shadow before storm

11 November 2008

Dark skies, bitter cold
Stopping for a pot of tea
I am warm again

12 November 2008

Leaves litter the floor
Detritus shuffled by feet
Walking in the door

13 November 2008

Sierpinski, you curr
Your sieve has no area
This tetrix hollow

14 November 2008

Walk the other side
And find that it's the same side
A strip Mobius

15 November 2008

Popcorn, so tasty
Confusing simplicity
Why is it so good?

16 November 2008

Tiny vibrations
Miniscule, an endless grove
A record crackles

17 November 2008

Disorder explodes
A frantic night seeks simple
Vegetable soup

18 November 2008

In the sky so bright
Twilight stars glitter and gleam
Figures in the night

19 November 2008

Front counter pusher
Black gold instead of the red
Sweet Kenyan nectar

20 November 2008

That the word `napkin'
Has nothing to do with naps
Shows the messed up world

21 November 2008

The wind gaining speed
Stealing my breath, leaving me
Cold, huddled, alive

22 November 2008

Eternal cycle
Clean, dirty, clean, dirty, clean
I hate entropy

23 November 2008

The cyclists dispatched
The food gathered, donated
Hot cider was had

24 November 2008

Quiet foreshadow
The slow trail up Mount Headache
The summit of pain

25 November 2008

Carrot cake lady
Oh yay, makes fruitcakes as well
My heart fills with joy!

26 November 2008

Time off emminent
And the will to work is gone
Nothing getting done

27 November 2008

An idea brewing
Leads to a kitchen monster
Dread quortanfurkey

28 November 2008

Plenty of caffeine
Allowing words to spill out
Typing all day long

29 November 2008

Bits constipated
Through the network slowly go
I want them faster

30 November 2008

Soft what snow falling
Lands upon the tired ground
Blanketing in white

1 December 2008

With icy scrapes I
Push around soft white snowfall
Annoying grinding

2 December 2008

Repetative thunk
The stapler pushing wire
Binding up pages

3 December 2008

Why is pickles the
First random word I think of?
How does my mind work?

4 December 2008

A trip to the store
Yielding random rubber stamps
Makes me glow happy

5 December 2008

Enough candy to choke
A medium sized pony
Sitting in a bowl

6 December 2008

I want nothing more
Than to sit for ten hours;
Saints lend me a chair

7 December 2008

Living room, once clean
Is filled again with boxes
A scourge in my life

8 December 2008

In sweaters, comfort
Wrapped in warmth, the world at bay
You find at last peace

9 December 2008

Recliner, hold me
At the end of a long day
You are there for me

10 December 2008

It happens each year
The first bad roads and people
Forget how to drive

11 December 2008

In the basement a
Fiery furnace glowing hot
Keeping the house warm

12 December 2008

A restless evening
Boredom strikes, and not shaken
Slows the hours, dull

13 December 2008

My internal map
Is a bit inaccurate
I drive in circles

14 December 2008

Old TV programs
Drag me into a deep pit
Waste the day away

15 December 2008

Waiting for the bus
Watching the wind blow paper
Down an empty street

16 December 2008

The city rolls by
Dilligent students study 
For final exams

17 December 2008

The black faded brown
A ribbon stretched, torn, tattered
I need a new hat

18 December 2008

At the first sign of
boredom I scream ``You will not
get me!'' and sit down

19 December 2008

Grey, silent, hulking
Clouds hover as they drop snow
I sit inside, warm

20 December 2008

Everyone wants
To be where I want to be
Get out of my way

21 December 2008

Why are these cookies 
So damn tasty? Their siren
Song lures me to eat

22 December 2008

Sitting here at work
The day before vacation
I get nothing done

23 December 2008

Bernoulli screaming
As air whipping past the wing
Provides us with lift

24 December 2008

Crazy family
Growing more goofy each year
Makes the mind boggle

25 December 2008

Seeping and seeking
What was once inside a pipe
Leaks into the ground

26 December 2008

Dampness and wires
Current flows where it shouldn't
I throw the pliers

27 December 2008

Fluffy sweaters press
Squished between some socks and shirts
Will it all fit in?

28 December 2008

Frost gleaming, glowing
Brightly in the morning light
Melting it away

29 December 2008

Inconsequential
Light as air, transforms itself
Slams across the ground

30 December 2008

The kernel grinding
Compiling, system building
Waste time while I wait

31 December 2008

An extra second!
Leaps us into the New Year
As the Earth slows down

1 January 2009

Last vacation day
Tomorrow I go to work
No one will be there

2 January 2009

A green hobbit page
Everything is running well
Which makes me concerned

3 January 2009

Bits moving slowly
As I wait impatiently
I want them faster

4 January 2009

No hubris, boasting
That I do not need full gloves
My fingers freeze off

5 January 2009

From the socket comes
Juice that's infintesimal
Electrons, screaming

6 January 2009

Plentiful bounty
Always lacking that one thing
It almost seems planned

7 January 2009

In the rush to leave
I forget at home my lunch
Today I eat out

8 January 2009

The battle is waged
The frontline: the door, and the
Enemy is slush

9 January 2009

I'm in the shower
When the pager starts to beep
Unserver pain

10 January 2009

A twist of thread hangs
From the arm of my sweater
Waiting to get caught

11 January 2009

A mug of hot tea
Steam twisting in the sunlight
Centering, peaceful

12 January 2009

A dreadlock of cords
Cables twisted and knotted
An unruly mess

13 January 2009

How noble, popcorn
The stalky grass exploding
Kernels of delight

14 January 2009

The pile growing
Threatens to fall off the shelf
Oh, stupid junk mail

15 January 2009

The frigid weather
Making my hands dry and tough
Aligator skin

16 January 2009

In the afternoon
My brain addled with good food
I grow distracted

17 January 2009

Icicles of doom!
Hanging, biding out their time
Just waiting to strike

18 January 2009

In the Thunderdrome
Herds of people freezing cold
Playing bike polo

19 January 2009

Creak like an old man
The knee sore, bending is hard
I lack but a cane

20 January 2009

Snow filling the ground
Filling the sky, filling life
Filling everything

21 January 2009

A loud car ambles
Down the street, turns, then silence
Dog barking afar

22 January 2009

Things snap into place
Code running fast, debugging
And more is what's left

23 January 2009

I see the glowing
Glowing glowing city lights
Stain the sky above

24 January 2009

I awake to birds
A bright sky, longing for spring
The end of winter

25 January 2009

Dull sinus pressure
I'm thinking amputation
That might hurt a bit

26 January 2009

Type A bus driver
Spastic, too fastic, crazy
Get out of our way

27 January 2009

I'm an idiot
Stupid mistake wasting time
Making me grumpy

28 January 2009

Tape driver crashing
Brings sadness to TSM
Backups are halted

29 January 2009

This week is worthless
Interruptions taunting me
Getting nothing done

30 January 2009

I can't get away
The pager beeping, I see
That things are broken

31 January 2009

The hours changing
As we escape winters grasp
The thought of spring dawns

1 February 2009

The magic smoke flees
The arm is stopped, motion lost
At least no alarms

2 February 2009

Stuck in the same day
It too early for flapjacks?
When is tomorrow?

3 February 2009

Sudden cold shocks me
It was so nice yesterday
What happened last night?

4 February 2009

Rock Band is awesome
Early Weezer is easy
Black Sabbath defeats

5 February 2009

From Pittsfield Township
The smell of corn sweetener
Where does it come from?

6 February 2009

Winter's dying gasp
Explodes on the land and fades
The winds of spring blow

7 February 2009

A sigh of relief
Warm air washes over me
The sky brightly blue

8 February 2009

A day of baking
Cooking, cleaning, laundry done
I'm ready for bed

9 February 2009

A hole in my shoe
Salt wearing away canvas
I need to patch it

10 February 2009

The pantry hides some
Seriously weird items
When did I buy this?

11 February 2009

Recliner! Genius!
A chair made for lounging in
Sit, relax, enjoy!

12 February 2009

False spring comes and goes
A brief glimmer of hope shines
And is dashed by clouds

13 February 2009

Name space exhausted
The Captain causes panic
Fast disapated

14 February 2009

Spoon fold fold fold roll
Grape leaves stand loose when I want
Neat little bundles

15 February 2009

Dishes then cooking
Leads to a dirty sink and
No gumption to wash

16 February 2009

Confusion do over
Not paying attention sucks
Only took four times

17 February 2009

Wake early morning
No more sleep for me this morn
Coffee is my balm

18 February 2009

Staying late at work
Making me miss Rock Band Night
I will drum next week

19 February 2009

Should we stay or go?
Passthrough is weird, we decide
A week more is good

20 February 2009

Elbow Room rockin' 
The tunes of Wally Dogger
Blast the room with sound

21 February 2009

Pizza craving strong
I sucumb and order one
Too lazy to cook

22 February 2009

Ginger beer burning
At last strong enough for me
Let's see how it fares

23 February 2009

Salt eats many things
But putting holes in my shoes?
That seems a bit much

24 February 2009

I've barely been here
But the sink is almost full
Must have dishes gnomes

25 February 2009

In the morning rush
I forgot to take my lunch
Eating out today

26 February 2009

Exhaustion tonight
The brain, wanting nothing, slacks
I hope its done soon

27 February 2009

Tiny French presses
Just perfect for making tea
Line the shelf, shiny

28 February 2009

Cold yet bracing day
The sun shining bright on high
Will the cold leave us?

1 March 2009

Hidden highways snake
Passages long lost to light
Where does that vent go?

2 March 2009

Time flies left unwatched
Observed slows to a dead crawl
Don't look and work ends

3 March 2009

Brain wandering on
Tuesday nothing to do day
It snaps, I go off

4 March 2009

The gaze through the screen
Interrupted by old smears
I need to clean it

5 March 2009

First class lever sharp
Slides through paper in a snap
I salute scissors

6 March 2009

Open bottles quick
Flick of the wrist, second class
Ease of use abounds

7 March 2009

The lever third class
A stick, some bristles, and work
A sweeping idea

8 March 200

A rock in my shoe
How do those ever get in?
My mind is baffled

9 March 2009

Solid sand gets snapped
Two halves and some sharp shards fall
I need a new plate

10 March 2009

A walk in the rain
Water flowing past my feet
The streets glistening

11 March 2009

The skies above clear
The wind, emboldened, screaming
Shouting out my name

12 March 2009

In a funk walking
A coney beckons, plate lands
Happy for a bit

13 March 2009

The rains are gone but
The ground is still squishy wet
Shoes keep my toes dry

14 March 2009

Hold a rope at one
Go around the circle full
Twice pi you have gone

15 March 2009

Ten folks bike polo
The sun shining the day warm
Outside is so good

16 March 2009

On nights like tonight
I feel like my apartment
Is just for my stuff

17 March 2009

On a cool spring night
Idiots drunk and braying;
I bike around them

18 March 2009

A spiral quickens
Steel held back fully released
The recliner sighs

19 March 2009

I almost stay home
Too many meetings today
I leave early, though

20 March 2009

Oh sweet! I'm Sick Tea!
Tea, lemon, ginger, honey
Good for what ails ya!

21 March 2009

I sleep the day through
And read Wikipedia
Sometimes, I find food

22 March 2009

My laptop is full
There's no more room for stickers
Need another one

23 March 2009

Ears full, my humming
Resonates inside my head
An organ for me

24 March 2009

The doctor's office
Nurse gags me with a q-tip
At least it's not strep

25 March 2009

Back to work today
Still out of it, but better
Flee the apartment

26 March 2009

A knot I don't know
The instructions don't make sense
My mind is tied up

27 March 2009

Alluring popcorn
Complex in simplicity
Corn heat salt and eat

28 March 2009 

Ears plugged, sounds muffled
The grocery store in a daze
Need more apple juice

29 March 2009

What soft from the sky
Falls upon the late March ground?
Snow, for one last turn

30 March 2009

Blue and white tiles
A sign of sanitation
Cleanliness abounds

31 March 2009

How does it grow right?
The skin of an apple fits
The fruit perfectly

1 April 2009

Thing built long ago
Could have been done easier
Now I think of it

2 April 2009

A concert tonight
But then I grow too tired
And I just go home

3 April 2009

At the laundromat
I am used to smelling soap
But smelling French fries?

4 April 2009

Across the landscape
Lines of steel bend and wander
I hurtle along

5 April 2009

April showers bring
May flowers, but what comes from
an April snow storm?

6 April 2009

Zines and records tempt
Wandering through Chicago
They jump in my arms

7 April 2009

A line, high tension
Electrons scream, silently
Quiet becomes light

8 April 2009

Kill time at the park
A giant shiny orb sits
Watching me reading

9 April 2009

When you become bored
Sometimes you make up a game
Count to one thousand

10 April 2009

Random inventions:
Who first twisted some wire
Making coat hangers?

11 April 2009

Flash on or flash off?
Go slower or go faster?
This sign has options.

12 April 2009

The tree out front is 
Budding, and all down the street 
Springtime is now here

13 April 2009

Grating and stiring
Filter, pour into bottles
A new brew is born

14 April 2009

Cap quickly opened
Ginger beer gushes about
Tricksy cinnamon

15 April 2009

My mind not thinking
Gets coffee at nine pm
My mind racing now

16 April 2009

Those tings! that I heard
Not one but two spokes snapping;
My tire needs work

17 April 2009

This race is not one
But we had a nice ride and
Hung at the Corner.

18 April 2009

Again, espresso
Makes my brain a whirling mad
Wonderful engine

19 April 2009

A mini tune up
A fine way to pass the time
I should clean my chain

20 April 2009

Just when things make sense
A bizzare error throws me off
I must think on it

21 April 2009

A strident whistle
Wresting me from my slumber
I log in, bring calm

22 April 2009

Dig through code again
My brain hurts and wants to stop
So I head for home

23 April 2009

Belly of ramen
Glowing with added kimchee
What could be better?

24 April 2009

I'm an idiot
To think my apartment would
Be cleaned Friday night

25 April 2009

Hours at the Mug
Caffeine helps me write some code
Now my brain is fried

26 April 2009

Epic slo-mo crash
Seat bent, gash in my right shin.
Hotties dig scars, right?

27 April 2009

Oh, couscous, devine
That tiny pasta so neat
But is it pasta?

28 April 2009

What day is today?
Is today really Tuesday?
I get so confused.

29 April 2009

The protector fades
Keys cover becomes dirty
And so do the keys

30 April 2009

Organizing stuff
My living room starts to fill
Piles everywhere

1 May 2009

Workers of the world
Unite! You have nothing to
Lose but your sorrow.

2 May 2009

A sunny morning
At the depot, tasty food
Yay, Farmer's Market

3 May 2009

Sunday afternoon
The park loud, people biking
I smile, happy

4 May 2009

Somewhere is a box
In it, a part that I need
Someday, I'll find it

5 May 2009

I lean on a shelf
It shifts, some books shuffle down
I should not do that

6 May 2009

In a building sits
A room of sand, unfinished
Waiting to be used

7 May 2009

O Mystery Jar
What secrets are you keeping
Hidden in my fridge?

8 May 2009

Water soft, ice hard
Both conspire to destroy
Michigan's roadways

9 May 2009

This cord, twisted hard,
What monkey put it away?
That monkey was me.

10 May 2009

Three times I have looked
Where something should be, later
It appears right there

11 May 2009

Seriously, dust
Where the hell do you come from?
I so hate sneezing

12 May 2009

Uploads take too long
Stupid pipe, be more faster
My data must go!

13 May 2009

With a flop it goes
Scrambled eggs falling aren't bad
But hot sauce stains well

14 May 2009

Nearly half way through
The month of May, flying by
Will soon be over

15 May 2009

Towering over
Dishes stacked ominously
The sink grows distressed

16 May 2009

Brave cyclists roaming
Finding junk from far and wide
Cleaning up the roads

17 May 2009

Polo rocked today
Things made sense, I scored a goal
And I didn't crash

18 May 2009

Boxes, bags to move
A car, stuffed full, lumbers on
Back and forth, a lot

19 May 2009

Kimchee on two days
Is there anything better
I do not think so

20 May 2009

Why do you not run?
Init says you should restart.
I hate this machine

21 May 2009

Warm weather settles
And collectively a sigh
Flows across the land

22 May 2009

Late at the wedding
Limbered up, I show all the
Universal dance

23 May 2009

You're in a code maze
Twisty passages, alike
Bends straighten, make sense

24 May 2009

Two goals at polo
A goal three weeks in a row
It's kinda scary

25 May 2009

I tear you apart
O creaky bottom bracket
You quiet a bit

26 May 2009

It's doughnuts we seek
A meeting gone on too long
We do not find them

27 May 2009

I love short work weeks
They are so good we should have
Them every week

28 May 2009

Where is that book at?
I know for sure I own it
But it's in no box

29 May 2009

Conference next week
Guess I should write my talk then
Procrastination

30 May 2009

Errands all day long
At least I was productive
And got in a nap

31 May 2009

The talk, now finished
Needs a lot of practice runs.
Stay strong, my poor throat

1 June 2009

To Lake Orion
In the middle of nowhere
I buy a new bike

2 June 2009

On this flight they serve
Those little bags of peanuts
I thought that was dead

3 June 2009

In case of earthquake
We are told where we should go
The ground does not shake

4 June 2009

The SLAC Research Lab:
``Unique Hazards May Exist"
I'd buy that t-shirt

5 June 2009

Fire in the air
A transformer all alit
Causes some panic

6 June 2009

The city beckons
And I sucumb to its charms
It draws me; I walk

7 June 2009

Flying, we defer
Now in first class we're riding
Be nice to gate clerks

8 June 2009

Sleep schedule messed up
Tomorrow I'll pay for it
But today I nap

9 June 2009

Returning to work
I wonder what I do here
Slogging through e-mails

10 June 2009

Parts accumulate
In a box they sit, tempting
``Make something with me"

11 June 2009

Mary stands, looking
Stone still over a small park
Ignoring traffic

12 June 2009

Tree fluff floating down
A mirror of the winter past
This snow is not cold

13 June 2009

Like a campfire
But more fragrant, the smell of
Coffee beans roasting

14 June 2009

A sink, clean, empty
A rare sight these hectic days
Bright steel oasis

15 June 2009

Sullen IT folks
In a courtyard, drinking beer
A merger cometh

16 June 2009

Down the street walking
I see Ahmadinejad
No, it's just some guy

17 June 2009

Tiny rocks, polished
Surrounding a tree; I stare
Waiting for the bus

18 June 2009

Old guy biking by
Meandering down the walk
Ignoring the world

19 June 2009

Guy smoking out front
Takes a shot of espresso
Needs more stimulus

20 June 2009

Fifth ginger beer batch
Sucanat and some spices
Interesting taste

21 June 2009

This voice annoys me
Scratching across the blackboard
Lodged in my poor mind

22 June 2009

Words make images
Flash on the screen of the mind
Curtain drawn, I sleep

23 June 2009

Procrastination
Delays in stuff I need done
Worry tomorrow

24 June 2009

A box of q-tips
Made in the United States
Packed in India

25 June 2009

Sitting innocent
The box I stub my toe on
``Oh, did I do that?"

26 June 2009

At the last moment
Everything thrown together
Living room suffers

27 June 2009

They ride, they collect
Some eight-hundred fifteen pounds
For Food Gatherers

28 June 2009

Sitting, cool, I write
Drink coffee, discuss zombies
Sunday at the Mug

29 June 2009

I'm still sore today
Must have been some good matches
When I ache this late

30 June 2009

The world grows fuzzy
``I must act!" blur swish wish wash
My glasses are clean

1 July 2009

At work this morning
I blasted `O Canada'
I need a trip soon

2 July 2009

A photon hits glass
It slows a bit, and bending
Leaves by a new path

3 July 2009

A pleasant day had
Errands ran, a bit of rain
I love these days off

4 July 2009

While in a parade
There is nothing finer than
Drive-through espresso

5 July 2009

Metal forged, graceful
Curves describing a sharp arc
Force cuts, wickedly

6 July 2009

What a pause it gives
Bits flowing by my control
I'm surprised it works

7 July 2009

Not sure what I ate
But it knocked me out hardcore
I stay home today

8 July 2009

People atwitter
Much ado about nothing
What's same is the change 

9 July 2009

Tape, sticking to things
But not sticking to itself
My mind kinda hurts

10 July 2009

Week draws to an end
Friday afternoon, work done
I just want to go

11 July 2009

What more do I need?
Lists of things a mile long
And I forget one

12 July 2009

With each turn a creak
Metal whines to be replaced
New bottom bracket

13 July 2009

At the last minute
I do all of my best work
Focus, no dawdle

14 July 2009

Network slow, grinding
Bits transfer lacklusterly
I need more bandwidth

15 July 2009

The talk that one hears
When interesting folks meet
Music to my ears

16 July 2009

It all snaps in place
Layout done, things lining up
I finish and sigh

17 July 2009

Printing twenty-five
I notice the misspelling
How did that sneak through?

18 July 2009

This day was well spent:
Twelve hours, forty artists
And a lot of beer

19 July 2009

A year more living
All I do is make cupcakes
And get on with life

20 July 2009

I hate computers
Which works out right in the end
Because they hate me

21 July 2009

This module sucks
Multiple rx_Init
It should not do that

22 July 2009

In a basement damp
Water, shattered by a ball
Bike polo brings light

23 July 2009

Sometimes I wonder:
Should I have stayed back in Ames?
It was right to leave

24 July 2009

The nothing evening
Some tea, then holed up at home
Stuck in old man mode

25 July 2009

Unexpected treat
A can of cashews, frozen
Tasty cold nuggets

26 July 2009

Dishes in stages
The mind wanders, a sink done
A new way to clean

27 July 2009

It is sad, really
Slept well, yet have no gumption
Do I need less sleep?

28 July 2009

Down with pants, I say
Kilts are more comfortable
And easy to make

29 July 2009

Mix CD promised
Months ago delivered now
Better late than not

30 July 2009

Strategy, planning
Lines of defense on a map
Resist the zombies

31 July 2009

Foamy, cold and black
Water dripping down the glass
Iced coffee, so good

1 August 2009

A storm, nothing
An industrial specter
I watch from a chair

2 August 2009

Don't you try it, punk
Steal my bike, get a beatdown
Your karma tarnished

3 August 2009

Sleep late, still tired
The week just new already
Promises to blow

4 August 2009

Stickers that don't peel
Making my life difficult
A needle helps out

5 August 2009

If you cease to fork
This library will screw you
It gives me much pain

6 August 2009

Dream reality
Beating real reality
The brain playing tricks

7 August 2009

Late night restarting
Servers getting upgraded
AFS runs smooth
 
8 August 2009

Cleaning the kitchen
A fine thing for one to do
But then dirty it?

9 August 2009

Holing up today
AC on, dim lit reading
A cave of coolness

10 August 2009

Cold fingers clasping
Open and close, bend and fold
Without me, doors stick

11 August 2009

Packets, screaming, slam
A network out of its mind
My island, battered

12 August 2009

A picture conveys
Words describe what is hidden
Both here devastate

13 August 2009

That shelf, once a tree
That tree, once naught but a seed
That seed, once a star

14 August 2009

Friday afternoon
Nothing done, nothing to do
The weekend, lets go!

15 August 2009

Early morning gump
Quickly halts from a breakdown
So I take a nap

16 August 2009

Carpet fuzzies roam
In that under-slumber land
Dark, unknown, hidden

17 August 2009

This week, I don't know
I'm not sure I'm feeling it
The weekend, far off

18 August 2009

Doctor Krakers cures
The hunger growing hours
His crunch is your cure

19 August 2009

Sometimes force gives strength
Other times it brings ruin
Do not confuse them

20 August 2009

The throwdown happens
Mad haters dising the Mug
Scoring stupidly

21 August 2009

Having urges to
Do some weird networking stuff
Thankfully, I stop

22 August 2009

It takes but a glitch
Many find their day ruined
At MACC twice today

23 August 2009

Starting as an itch
Then a fever joins the fun
Coughing, oh what fun

24 August 2009

Staying home today
Sleeping for hours, and then
Laundry, oh what fun

25 August 2009

A sudden craving
Ice cream, waffle cone, two scoops
Where did that come from?

26 August 2009

A twist, a turn, fold
Once flat, boring, regular
Now a complex form

27 August 2009

A hint, trees turning
Whisper that fall is coming
``No summer!'' I shout

28 August 2009

Summer never came
And a torrent of water
Washes up for fall

29 August 2009

Threads unraveling
Order into disorder
I need some new socks

30 August 2009

So much is built on
A chemical reaction
Liquid becomes stone

31 August 2009

Outside the sky dims
And pockts of light turn on
My heart grows brighter

1 September 2009

Fall thuds into place
Shoving Summer, never here,
Even more aside

2 September 2009

Stuff begats more stuff
And an endless box parade
Marches by my door

3 September 2009

Thursday morning burns
Dew from all the window shields
No excuse; to work

4 September 2009

What the hell's that noise?
Cats fight, or strange aliens.
I shut the window.

5 September 2009

Turn on all the lights
Let them hold back the darkness
Switch them off, go home

6 September 2009

Clean and clean some more
Make the apartment spiffy
Though it won't last

7 September 2009

What beauty, doughnuts
A simple ring of pure joy
Sublime yet tasty

8 September 2009

In my coffee mug
Echo of a thousand cups
Keeping me awake

9 September 2009

At the day's first light
I awake, and start to whine
Left the shades open

10 September 2009

Oh headache, leave me
Your antics do not amuse
I want you to go

11 September 2009

Oh, apple cider!
Thy simplicity rings true
Nothing can compare

12 September 2009

Sun in the window
Interrupting my sweet nap
Curse and it remains

13 September 2009

Slender, pushed, twisted
The ka-chunk holds together
Things from the stapler

14 September 2009

Apartment straightened
If not neat, at least it's clean
That will do just fine

15 September 2009

Enough energy
Grocery shopping is done;
But not making food

16 September 2009

Raw numbers in code
Dangerous when not needed
I sigh and move on

17 September 2009

My mind, wandering
Creates universes weird
Strange, unknowable

18 September 2009

To get a letter
Undertake a simple task
Just send a letter

19 September 2009

The simple beauty
Of a slice of break, toasted
Sublime majesty

20 September 2009

Here's how you do it
But the instructions don't work
This sign angers me

21 September 2009

Sleep schedule mess
Awake and sleepy mixed up
Caffeine does not fix

22 September 2009 

A sock do-si-does
Dancing with a pair of pants
Bowing to a shirt

23 September 2009

Dreary day today
The storm's parade rained on though
As the Sun peeks out

24 September 2009

Flowers stare blindly
Unseeing, yet knowing fate
Their time will soon fade

25 September 2009

Five years of the Mug
There are ballons, and a cake
The perfect week cap

26 September 2009

Taco Tour Two
Bike across Ypsilanti
Six stops and then beer

27 September 2009

Tiny little hole
There at the side of the road
What's your mystery?

28 September 2009

Some words make no sense
Example: twitterpated
I just don't get it

29 September 2009

Tiny lights blinking
Flashing out a faint tattoo
Can you understand?

30 September 2009

Clean but not too clean
Don't look like a slob but don't
Act like that's your plan

1 October 2009

The rain obscuring
Lines in the road blury, dark
Making driving fun

2 October 2009

Wandering about
Showing relatives around
Chocolate is found

3 October 2009

A grey sky above
The fruits of nature laid out
Walk in the Market

4 October 2009

I am random junk
Look upon all these craft stores
And you will dispair

5 October 2009

The train departed
Leaves me tired but happy
What better, a nap.

6 October 2009

What can Tuesday say?
Not a start, middle or end
Just there, existing

7 October 2009

Little beetle fly
Your time has come to be off
My place not your home

8 October 2009

They Might Be Giants
Playing at St. Andrew's Hall
The night was rockin'

9 October 2009

Glorious day off
Possibilities endless
Ends up in napping

10 October 2009

Small iceburg floating
Takes heat to keep a drink cold
Then it's forgotten

11 October 2009

Spiral of wire
Twisting, turning, grabbing cork
Opens the bottle

12 October 2009

Light, hitting glass, slows
In some parts more than others
A lens brings focus

13 October 2009

Tiny globes glow green
Floating in soup, or salads
Peas, small rounds of good

14 October 2009

Trees loom over us
And when the wind blows they shake
Showing their fury

15 October 2009

We dance, for doughnuts
Have manifested themselves!
Unlimited joy.

16 October 2009

Grey sky blanketing
A cold that fills me with life
I walk, warm, content

17 October 2009

Once again I find
My craftiness ideas far
Exceed my skill set

18 October 2009

Small things compounding
In a blink, become large things
Oh woe my dishes

19 October 2009

Shoulda stayed in bed
This week is not welcoming
I'll try for the next

20 October 2009

A package not found
Suddenly, it arriving
Brightens my dull day

21 October 2009

As I do dishes
The Flaming Lips are playing
I scrub; they keep tune

22 October 2009

Is frozen pizza
Healthy when it is dinner
Three nights in a row?
 
23 October 2009

Package, forgotten
Suddenly in my post box
A pleasant surprise

24 October 2009

"It's on the shelf there"
Several minutes later
Guess where it is found?

25 October 2009

A pleasant bike ride
Cider and doughnuts appear
What could be better?

26 October 2009

One day, sometime soon
I'll be able to slow down
Today's not that day

27 October 2009

Thirteen years cover
Comes off in a few minutes
My chin feels cold

28 October 2009

Arise, ye sleepers!
Is what my alarm clock would 
Say if I set it

29 October 2009

Bits of yarn abound
As if my carpet, shedding,
Is freeing its coat

30 October 2009

Rain does not deter
Zombies and zombie hunters
Mass slaughter occurs

31 October 2009

Cleaning up mold leaves
A faint tickle in my throat
Coffee does not quench

1 November 2009

Weird wireless thing
Why do you only half work?
What a piece of junk

2 November 2009

Drain running slowly
Oh how I am hating you
Go faster, dammit

3 November 2009

When bits, gathering
Coalesce into order
Data is produced

4 November 2009

Forgetting to run
tune2fs -c 
Causes long boot times

5 November 2009

Work today gave me
A productivity glow
Now I want a nap

6 November 2009

Night in Ann Arbor
No one knows how to drive here
I'm shaking my fist

7 November 2009

A chill in the air
And yet a pot of hot tea
Keeps the cold away

8 November 2009

Down into the drome
There is shootoff confusion
Damn hockey people

9 November 2009

What zine should I read?
The pile grows ever large
Making a hard choice

10 November 2009

Friend Insomnia
You got me up too early
My head is splitting

11 November 2009

Bored and twisting twine
I find I've made a bracelet
Close, but not knitting

12 November 2009

The bricks, holding cold
Make a chilly atmosphere
Ready for sweaters

13 November 2009

Seeking to balance
The time spent on many paths
Tread lightly, but tread

14 November 2009

Jacket November
Leaves me wondering if it
Will ever get cold

15 November 2009 

As the sky darkens
We do not slow down, we move
Where there is bright light

16 November 2009

Walking out at night
A quiet city, clear skies
And I'm filled with life

17 November 2009

The sky slides, tilting
Stars becoming a jumble
Before they go out

18 November 2009

Speech becoming bits
Becoming words on paper
An interview done

19 November 2009

The mad rush begins
When from vapor words align
Fixed eternally

20 November 2009

In the night a bump
My toe and the bookcase meet
It is not happy

21 November 2009

Start with simple things
Complexity will find you
Even if you hide

22 November 2009

As I type, grimace
Frozen peas ersatz first aid
Bring little relief

23 November 2009

And why should I sleep?
With every move my thumb screams
Oh just chop it off!

24 November 2009

Dreaming monopoles
Stuck together forever
Can they ever be?

25 November 2009

Gimpy hand dishes
Should have been done days ago
Will I ever learn?

26 November 2009

The gluttony done
Lord of the Rings all day long
With some random naps

27 November 2009

My usual mix
I should be more productive
Manage at least some

28 November 2009

Once loud, now murmur
Voices ringing out proud, strong
Now grow quiet, soft

29 November 2009

In a flash, dark pales
And trapped for eternity
Light in its fair dance

30 November 2009

The splint is removed
Nothing broken, still tender
Sad bruises don't scar

1 December 2009

Excitement brightens
And in its way lights the path
Pale in its guidance

2 December 2009

``I am become cake,
Tasty snack of tasty snacks
Look at me and nosh"

3 December 2009

The water swirling
Does not wash away my sins
Unless dishes count

4 December 2009

In bringing order
There is chaos revealing
A crimp in the plans

5 December 2009

Standing twelve hours
Walking about, helping out
The Shadow Art Fair

6 December 2009

The day starts anew
I wonder where my shoes are
Oh, under the chair

7 December 2009

Under too much stress
It reacts with a loud snap
Making power safe

8 December 2009

Stuff high on a shelf
All self-inflicted mathom
No will to toss it

9 December 2009

Trite arithmatic
Making my brain curl up
Sums not adding up

10 December 2009

My old age revealed
Too much cheese upon my plate
A younger self weeps

11 December 2009

A cold universe
Metal grinds eternally
Sweeping out the time

12 December 2009

Some simple errands
End up taking forever
Driving me insane

13 December 2009

Solitary leaf
Steadfast and not giving up
Winter does not sway

14 December 2009

Thinning to strengthen
A sinuous arc, deadly
At the edge force falls

15 December 2009

What is in this box,
And why do I still have it?
Less junk, my new goal

16 December 2009

From below the ground
You're torn, ground and made to stand
Gypsum, I salute!

17 December 2009

Detergent freezes
A fact that's useful to know
When it's cold outside

18 December 2009

A gnawing pressure
Creeping, hiding, dark ichor
Jumps alive, ear ache

19 December 2009

Tea keeps me alive
That in such a simple gift
Should be that power

20 December 2009

The world becomes bright
And what was once elusive
Suddenly appears

21 December 2009

The morning hour
Appearing before it should
Awake before dawn

22 December 2009

Year's last day of work
Is not making me feel like
Doing anything

23 December 2009

Iowa below
Welcomes with a winter storm
Dancing in the sky

24 December 2009

Village full of life
Frozen in time, shrunk and still
Exist, fade, exist

25 December 2009

The cutting cold wind
Causes haste going one way
Pause in the other

26 December 2009

Well the well's now well
From the dark depths come water
A mighty trickle

27 December 2009

A compact order
Piles become folded, packed
The airy grows dense

28 December 2009

I missed you, coffee!
Six days I've had but water
Slumping in my mug

29 December 2009

Organization
At least the promise of it
Fills me with much joy

30 December 2009

The cold settles in
Ready to stay, patiently
Waiting out its time

31 December 2009

Farewell to the aughts
I'm glad that I lived through them
When I'm an old man

1 January 2010

Start the year quiet
A pot of tea, a warm robe
Music plays softly

2 January 2010

The wind, blustery
A brisk walk on a cold day
Hot coffee restores

3 January 2010

Last vacation day
It's worse than actual work
Since work looms ahead

4 January 2010

Inside, there is warmth
In the dark, a ray of light
The kitchen is cheer

5 Janaury 2010

For a task at hand
There exists no better way
Just wait, tomorrow

6 January 2010

When water comes near
Flour stirred becomes stretchy
Gluten makes good bread

7 Janaury 2010

Hello to you, Sun
Oh why must you bother me?
I just want to sleep

8 January 2010

Late night, early morn
Not a good combination
Tea will save me now

9 January 2010

I see clouds, racing
Blast across the sky, purple
In the setting Sun

10 January 2010

A cave, not of stone
Layers of blankets form this
Shelter of sweet sleep

11 January 2010

Liquid not flowing
Hard to the touch, shattering
Push it and it breaks

12 January 2010

Hole in the bucket
Making it hard to fill up
Leaking on my shoes

13 January 2010

From whence do you hail?
This mere electron, screaming
To the ground it goes

14 January 2010

Quickly the weekend
Aproaches, looming nearer
Work receeding, goes

15 January 2010

Once written, now test
Will a weekend of pounding
Make it stand or fail?

16 January 2010

Instead of cleaning
I go out to a movie
It is much more fun

17 January 2010

Long, green and stringy
Celery looms in my mind
A guest strangely there

18 January 2010

A tune unbidden
Music rumbling in my ears
Mind's inner soundtrack

19 January 2010

Pedalling quickly
Trying hard to go nowhere
As fast as they can

20 January 2010

A warm fuzzy cave
Invaded by a small draft
Blankets fall, I wake

21 January 2010

Electrons pushing
A gas, excited it glows
When bent, words outlined

22 January 2010

The horn toot of God
A sad anemic fog horn
Sound designer fail

23 January 2010

Small French presses gone
So a large French press is used.
More tea fine with me 

24 January 2010

Rain falls where snow was
Snow vainly stands, then dissolves
Wet ground uncaring

25 January 2010

Fan spins noisily
As an ersatz clothes dryer
Water falls away

26 January 2010

Grinding makes pressure
My eyes wanting to pop out
Go away headache

27 January 2010

When testing is done
More problems reveal themselves
Scream, sigh, debug, code

28 January 2010

Ribbon torn, falling
A bookmark disintegrates
Just dust on the floor

29 January 2010

Uneasy quiet
The pager calm for how long
Make it to monday?

30 January 2010

A day of gumption
Ripped to shred by a pager
No love, macc-lib-1

31 January 2010

Sweet fanny Jebus
The tape slots have gone away
Order is restored

1 February 2010

A reading backlog
And yet, I'm filled with boredom
Too many choices?

2 February 2010

A pot on the stove
For hours on a low heat
Contents abubble

3 February 2010

``Ah-ha'' I can say
The drowsy morning waking
Making my brain work

4 February 2010

Hands soaked in water
They get wrinkled and gritty
Once dry they're restored

5 February 2010

A bad week ending
And a day without working
Makes my mood lighter

6 February 2010

A wall of music
Solid sound pushing your ears
Stops. Quiet deafens

7 February 2010

There's an easy way
When you're picking up spilled pins
If there's a magnet....

8 February 2010

Drip ... drip ... drip ... drip ... drip ...
I can not make the sound stop
Drip ... drip ... drip ... drip ... drip ...

9 February 2010

Like a soybean sponge
Absorbing all kinds of stuff
Tofu, you suck well

10 February 2010

Calm in a large space
Squished becomes hot and angry
Compression of gas

11 February 2010

Quarter explosion
Coins spilling across the floor
Collect for laundry

12 February 2010

Swaying in the breeze
A slender wire moving
Makes a twisty path

13 February 2010

I wish for pickles
And yet no pickles arrive
What's wrong with this world?

14 February 2010

Some nights I go on
Wikipedia wanders
Where weird paths emerge

15 February 2010

The world, upside down
Different, exciting, new
There yet never there

16 February 2010

Simple yet complex
Can openers mesmerise
My beans are open

17 February 2010

High on Sherzer Hall
Look down on Ypsilanti
Absorb its beauty

18 February 2010

Soft in the distance
I hear a car horn honking
Over and over

19 February 2010

Tidy grows messy
The neverending battle
Fought against clutter

20 February 2010

A day of errands
When finished gives a sense of
Productivity

21 February 2010

No wheel, no polo
Instead, some photography
I'm trapping photons

22 February 2010

With heavy snowfall
My bloodpressure rises as 
Idiots abound

23 February 2010

There in a window
``As Seen On TV Sold Here''
That's a product now?

24 February 2010

The life of a mug
Full of hot, cold, maybe soup
The mug stays the same

25 February 2010

The sun does not rise
It's caused by the Earth spinning
Yet I see a rise

26 February 2010

Go away devil
The little imp in my head
A headache headache

27 February 2010

Song stuck in my head
A pleasant tune but no words
It is maddening

28 February 2010

February done?
Where the hell has this month gone?
Feel cheated somehow.

1 March 2010

Oh soup, I sing out
The joy you bring, exquisite
Fills my heart with glee

2 March 2010

Brain a whirlwind
Bringing order from chaos
Wind stops, brain cools down

3 March 2010

Stare into the night
Behold the stars high above
Feel small where you are

4 March 2010

Beware peer pressure
That lunch you brought in to work
Pales at their onslaught

5 March 2010

The old Friday role
Having caffeine and coding
Meeting up with friends

6 March 2010

Pleasantly full day
Going all over the place
Doing many things

7 March 2010

The winter basement
Pales against the spring outdoors
Polo moves outside

8 March 2010

Glorious day erupts
An early spring issues forth
Is winter now dead?

9 March 2010

Infinitely small
A point strung infinitely
A line, length from void

10 March 2010

These forms make no sense
Sitting in the waiting room
Health care confuses

11 March 2010

Go away snow, flee
Your cover is not wanted
Let the green return

12 March 2010

Bowling computer
You record our score, poorly
Have we confused you?

13 March 2010

Mailing us to say
You will soon be mailing us
Census makes no sense

14 March 2010

Total exhaustion
All I can do is sit there
Finally I move

15 March 2010

With a renewed shine
The sun illuminates us
Dark at lunch, light now

16 March 2010

I hear the city
Wafting through open windows
Moving the curtains

17 March 2010

Going for a walk
As the sun slowly sinking
Gives way to the night

18 March 2010

A drunken asshole
With a squeal and loud crash
Hits the neighbor's car

19 March 2010

The first green budding
In the hedge by a sidewalk
I walk by, smile

20 March 2010

Inside a book store
Pleasant hours can be spent
Good finds your reward

21 March 2010

Breakfast cravings rise
Leading to omlettes at night
Inverting is fun

22 March 2010

Woken up at 1
Leads to a long tired day
Going home early

23 March 2010

Drawing to a close
The evening turns to pastels
The day fades away

24 March 2010

I still want a kite
And a day spent in the park
Instead of working

25 March 2010

Invading my head
Some sort of rude snot monster
Here without asking

26 March 2010

A vain search reveals
Nothing at the pharmacy
To erase this snot

27 March 2010

The KDC fails
With abandon, ruthless dies
Restoration weird

28 March 2010

Ruthless is happy
Albeit hacked together
Next weekend will fix

29 March 2010

Dazed and confused I
Awake for another day
Will today make sense?

30 March 2010

A ladder reaching
Edging high into the sky
Stands grounded in Earth

31 March 2010

The sun, glorious
Reigning over the noon sky
Lighting all the world

1 April 2010

How I hate this day
The world, even more stupid
Annoying me more

2 April 2010

The world, split in two
Below, complicated, dense
Above, clear blue sky

3 April 2010

In the stars, pictures
Mundane minds, fantastic worlds
Dots and lines shine through

4 April 2010

A smell embedded
Where I keep my coffee beans
Makes my nose happy

5 April 2010

I hail the sky, blue
Above me on this Monday
As I head to work

6 April 2010

Goodbye to sweaters!
I enjoy your company,
But we need a break

7 April 2010

Banner, flying high
Whipping in the wind, it falls
Pile on the ground

8 April 2010

Clear orbular parts
Growing smudged for no reason
Why do they do this?

9 April 2010

Pizza rolls, devine
A packet of pure happy
Simple and sublime

10 April 2010

Hidden space opens
Behind the dash, voids and dust
Debris from ago

11 April 2010

Cool, yet the Sun shines
Forshadowing burns ahead
When it's not so nice

12 April 2010

Staring at the Sun
Making typing difficult
This window needs shade

13 April 2010

Pizza rolls, devine
A packet of pure happy
Simple and sublime

14 April 2010

Thoughts of libraries
Fill my head with happiness
Books overwhelm me

15 April 2010

Somewhere, a damn bird
Making a nest, making noise
Driving me crazy

16 April 2010

The week, ran ragged
Shudders to a halt, Friday
And life is easy

17 April 2010

When old books I see
I feel a need to help them
Just dollars a day

18 April 2010

I see the sun shine
And find myself drawn outside
Basking in the light

19 April 2010

Goofy wireless
Connections break frequently
The network, annoyed

20 April 2010

The whisper of wind
Through the window, lullaby
Easing me to sleep

21 April 2010

Red fabric beckons
To finish a costume lost
To interruption

22 April 2010

So that's how it works
That doesn't make any sense
Feh, this thing is dumb

23 April 2010

A good day at work
Followed by a fun evening
Recipe for joy

24 April 2010

Cleaning the kitchen
Before making the next mess
Need to fix timing

25 April 2010

Sundays are sleep days
Lounging in bed all day long
Why would I get up?

26 April 2010

Dreary rain outside
Yet early morning coffee
Makes it all better

27 April 2010

A faint smell returns
My mind to earlier times
Time travel by nose

28 April 2010

Something I do but
A few times a year, falling
Missing from my head

29 April 2010

How exactly does
One lose a sewing machine?
Oh where did it go?

30 April 2010

I am reminded
Of things I have to get done
Copious time gone

1 May 2010

The real labor day
Happens on the first of May
Despite what they say

2 May 2010

I don't mean to rhyme
But sometimes it just happens
Life works out that way

3 May 2010

Yards of cotton, twist
Warping and wefting a weave
In turn, a new shirt

4 May 2010

The jar, long hidden
Not enough mustard to use
Too much to dispose

5 May 2010

Forgetting my lunch
I go outside to find food
Why must I return?

6 May 2010

See also, I'm told
A page that I can not find
I hate all vendors

7 May 2010

Hello there, weekend
I've been missing you all week
Let's make this one last

8 May 2010

Sweet old lady with
Best Damn Carrot Cake Ever
Gets me ev'ry time

9 May 2010

Detritus collects
Nooks and cranys become home
For debris long lost

10 May 2010

On the way to work
People are like idiots
I will hate this week

11 May 2010

Bolts, nuts, strewn about
A box falling disaster
The floor a tableaux

12 May 2010

Middle of the street
A cat sits, staring at me
Bored, it wanders off

13 May 2010

School bus yellow car
You are the ugliest thing
Who picked your color?

14 May 2010

Giving a talk soon
I should probably write it
Do it tomorrow

15 May 2010

The days, longer now
Still feel as full and hectic
Calm them, summertime

16 May 2010

Too many movies
Or perhaps there's not enough
All of them look dull

17 May 2010

To-do lists make light
Piles of tasks to be done
Rounding up my life

18 May 2010

At a small table
Caffeine fuels cogitation
Work fuels relaxing

19 May 2010

Mid-week out too late
Makes for a painful Wednesday
I hate everything

20 May 2010

Floating in the wind
I am but a simple leaf
Trying to stay calm

21 May 2010

From thin filaments
A tenuous connection
A web, billowing

22 May 2010

Arranged in a row
Three tacos beckon to me
Tasty temptation

23 May 2010

Hours in the sun
An idiot, no sunscreen,
Quickly growing red

24 May 2010 

Laundry late at night
When I should be sleeping, chores
Keeping me going

25 May 2010

The Land of Lincoln
An open sky above us
Past Indiana

26 May 2010

What crafty folk put
Tortellini on Pizza?
It's tasty madness!

27 May 2010 

Once lost is now found
Dollar bill in my pocket
Backtrack, on sidewalk

28 May 2010

Shed of fireworks
The promise of big booms draw
The pyro in me

29 May 2010

Time zones screw me up
Even just one hour off
Throws off my routine

30 May 2010

Into the fence: Slam!
Well, that front fork is messed up
No polo today

31 May 2010

A window, open
To catch what breezes it may
The outside comes in

1 June 2010

Along the river
Grasses swaying in the breeze
Waving to the fish

2 June 2010

Hard and unyielding
Meets soft, sensative and tender
Staple in my foot

3 June 2010

In the fridge, I'm scared
A collection of jars sits
Cold, empty, must clean

4 June 2010

I speak of bread, dense
Forged strong in a hot oven
Giving us true life

5 June 2010

From a box, a line
That Fibonacci's ratio
Installs the devine

6 June 2010

A malt at night sought ---
Who could make tasty drink?
Ice cream come to me

7 June 2010

Not time to awake!
Yet clearly there is the Sun.
Oh go fuck off, Sun.

8 June 2010

Sudden ice cream urge
Passes when something shiny
Discombobulates

9 June 2010

Ponderously swung
A door reveals a cavern
Vaporous with cold

10 June 2010

The haste, in packing
Producing a small order
In a vast chaos

11 June 2010

Ten hours, a car
Music, coffee, and trail mix
I'm in Iowa

12 June 2010

The day a downpour
Growing calm, yet still muggy
And I'm in a suit

13 June 2010

Horay! Scooby Snacks.
A dish most devine arrives
Simple, tasty, good

14 June 2010

My old haunts I roam
They've changed, but still welcoming
I visit each one

15 June 2010

Lonely fried cheese ball
There a pool of ranch dressing
I drink some iced tea

16 June 2010

From Ames I depart
Off to Eastern Iowa
Before Michigan

17 June 2010

A day filled with stamps,
Folding, knoting and tying
Makes invitations

18 June 2010

A long drive past me
At last in Ypsilanti
Gone fun, home better

19 June 2010

Waiting to return
Humidity makes horrid
All being outside

20 June 2010

There is confusion
When one thinks about the world
Fixing that is life

21 June 2010

The bathroom, now clean
After an hour of work.
Good for months now, right?

22 June 2010

Boxes, all my life
Putting things in other things
Striving for order

23 June 2010

A graveyard, my car
The shells of many things there
Waiting for cleaning

24 June 2010

The cut of mustard
Burning a hole in my head
Strong yet flavorful

25 June 2010

More running, scrambling
Readying for tomorrow
Make a list, check it

26 June 2010

Seven, coming out
Gather food in the hundreds
Pedal for others

27 June 2010

Growing grey, the skies
Opening tormenting us
Rain flies, falls and fades

28 June 2010

Normally silent
Now you cry out as you bend
This hinge, annoying

29 June 2010

A deep growl rings out
Sputtering, coughing, unwell
My car is crappy

30 June 2010

This knot, confounding
An ache sits in my shoulder
Tying happiness

1 July 2010

O Fair Canada
I yearn to return to you
Apart far too long

2 July 2010

The day, smoothly goes
Slams to a frustrating stop
A long weekend saves

3 July 2010

Beside the Huron
The Night of the Hunter plays
Screen glows in the night

4 July 2010

Too hot to do much
I spend Independence Day
In where it is cool

5 July 2010

A day off is filled
Scrambling to finish errands
No rest here today

6 July 2010

A plan in my mind
Changes to one different
At the hardware store

7 July 2010

A bit of crafty
Producing a pleasant glow
Inside of my mind

8 July 2010

The printer now done
Can only mean one thing left
Staplepalooza!

9 July 2010

In these boxes lie
Everything you might need
Plus a bunch of tape

10 July 2010

Those hours standing
Thousands of people go by
Sitting well with me

11 July 2010

Why am I up now?
The lure of sleeping in strong
But not strong enough

12 July 2010

Like a waterfall
Just one that can catch fire
Fuel leak in my car

13 July 2010

It can be cool here
If you sit in the shade and
Don't move a muscle

14 July 2010

In an asphalt sea
An oasis of green lives
Against all reason

15 July 2010

The drone of a fan
A one-chord symphony plays
Eat your heart out, Cage

16 July 2010

A box holds a slot
The slot, taking envelopes,
Sends them on their way

17 July 2010

What we used to do
In keeping fire at bay
Fills a museum

18 July 2010

Busy bees buzzing
On flowers of all the hues
Grey skies sit above

19 July 2010

Once more 'round the Sun
Thirty-two times in my life
I'm getting dizzy

20 July 2010

Bluish-grey billows
Massing above a peach sky
Rain --- but colorful

21 July 2010

Lazyness tonight
Chinese takeout tempting me
Spring roll's siren song

22 July 2010

Air cools, but dances
To the drum beats of thunder
Inside it grows dark

23 July 2010

It's balls ass hot outside
I breathe out and it feels cool
That's just not right, folks

24 July 2010

Long into the night
I wait for power's return
Generators sad

25 July 2010

Dare I venture out?
Will I become sticky goo?
Hey, it's nice outside

26 July 2010

Venture from the cave
A life, somewhat more normal
Eyes bleary, blinking

27 July 2010

Things that can be done
Stopped by the lack of magic
Bits drive me crazy

28 July 2010

Between two large fields
A slender slip dividing
Limiting movement

29 July 2010

What once appeared new
Fading over time, dulling,
Becomes sad, yet proud

30 July 2010

Glorious day off
Wandering around, lazy
My mind is relaxed

31 July 2010

Where does this come from?
I just cleaned this thing last week
It's dirty again

1 August 2010

A sandwich, layered
Towering tome of tasty
Laminar goodness

2 August 2010

Getting confused, stop
Simple things making no sense
Return tomorrow

3 August 2010

I will beat this thing
Oh yay, I have beat this thing!
Still have to beat this.

4 August 2010

Cup, sitting lonely
Waiting for a saucer friend
Slowly growing cold

5 August 2010

This automation
Beating into submission
Things recalcitrant

6 August 2010

Like sand falling down
This hole, while getting undug
Goes but a trickle

7 August 2010

An album boring
Has the most sublime cover
The devil, hot dog

8 August 2010

There are two sevens
One in the morn, one evening
I picked the wrong one

9 August 2010

The cake, while tasty
Left over a knife to clean
A cutting mission

10 August 2010

Heat and pressure yields
Layered shiny, troubling
Too much, too little

11 August 2010

Oh sweet sweet cupcake
While your frosting is pretty
Your filling tempts me

12 August 2010

One task now finished
Reveals three more yet to go
An endless slogging

13 August 2010

There is Thai for lunch
Then it is Thai for dinner
I'm okay with that

14 August 2010

I can see the days
Growing shorter with each week
Fall glowing closer

15 August 2010

Thin clouds, riding high,
Are no respite from the Sun;
The shade, welcoming

16 August 2010

The new toy delay
Waiting for delivery
Testing your patience

17 August 2010

An idea, bursting
Explosive, a problem solved
If it just made sense

18 August 2010

Boop boop boop boop boop
Stuck in my head, the song goes
Boop boop boop boop boop

19 August 2010

Slowly the minutes
Marching forward to the past
Encircle hours

20 August 2010

Forward, back, around
Rotation becomes a line
I drive home from work

21 August 2010

A soft mist of rain
Clouding the entire day
Rare clarity shows

22 August 2010

That's where that book went
Nowhere close to a sane place
It's hiding from me

23 August 2010

Late night bike polo
Deep in the parking garage
Bright light in the dark

24 August 2010

A bowl of lentils
Whispers when my finger stirs
A sweet melody

25 August 2010

Getting mail is fun
But it does not compare to
The fun of sending

26 August 2010

A cool breeze blowing
Causes dancing to break out
In the window shade

27 August 2010

Over and over
The same question, same answer
Stop asking me that

28 August 2010

Baking ensuing
Broadcasting a tempting smell
Through the apartment

29 August 2010

Our path meanders
All over Ypsilanti
Wanderers not lost

30 August 2010

Random road closings
A riot of orange appears
You're not getting there

31 August 2010

Procrastination
Tells me to pack tomorrow
Instead of tonight

1 September 2010

Hours in the car
Michigan to Iowa
Makes one glad to stop

2 September 2010

First too hot, then cold
This blanket lacks in-between
Half on, half off works


3 September 2010

Wireless almost
An ethereal yoga
Just to get signal

4 September 2010

The day dawning cool
I'm thankful for the weather
In a goofy suit

5 September 2010

Things slower today
Welcome from running around
To sit and find calm

6 September 2010

Hours and miles
Wind behind me, like a trail
Between there and here

7 September 2010

Bored with newspaper
I attempt to make a hat
Have no head for it

8 September 2010

I'm on vacation
And yet my brain won't turn off
Just go to sleep, brain

9 September 2010

Hours spent coding
At my local coffee shop
Strangely relaxes

10 September 2010

Unsure what to eat
The number 10 satisfies
Coney islands rock

11 September 2010

Today I will Clean!
Okay, instead I will just clean.
Give me a break, `kay?

12 September 2010

Back in the saddle
After an absence too long
It feels good to ride

13 September 2010

Ten days off work
And I forget what we do
Read e-mail, I guess

14 September 2010

My brain turns to mush
As this insipid song plays
Cork my ears oh please

15 September 2010

The healing power
Better than all medicines
Perfect, simple soup

16 September 2010

Divebombing house fly
Pulls up, lazy spiraling
Leave my airspace now

17 September 2010

The afternoon drags
Delaying still the weekend
Soon that breaks, it's here

18 September 2010

The day is too packed
And there is no tomorrow
To do all these things

19 September 2010

Wandering Pittsburgh
There is topography here
All of it uphill

20 September 2010

I am on the bus
And using the internet
I love the future

21 September 2010

Going overboard
Is easy when making soup
Use your biggest pot

22 September 2010

The draw of cider
Starts its yearly temptations
Call of doughnuts strong

23 September 2010

Summer, a last burst
Bright blue skies and warm breezes
Give a last hurrah

24 September 2010

Molasses flowing
Goes faster than this machine
It crawls and I sigh

25 September 2010

The cold drawing near
Causes me to draw inward
I go out refreshed

26 September 2010

Alluring orange juice
Drawing me out of the house
These cravings are weird

27 September 2010

With a snap, cold falls
The degrees sliding downwards
Pulling leaves with them

28 September 2010

Squinting at the sky
And when did it start raining?
This should not surprise....

29 September 2010

Having broken this
We try it again to see
If the breaking stops

30 September 2010

Glad to close windows
The house, once cool, now grows warm
Winter's on its way

Taco Tour Tres Special Haiku

1 - Dos Hermanos
The word frijoles
Is a key thing to know here
Carne otherwise

2 - Los Amigos
Off in the distance
At the end of a long road
Los Amigos sits

3 - La Fiesta Mexicana
Nestled on Cross Street
Fiesta Mexicana
Potato tacos

4 - Taqueria La Fiesta
La Fiesta Calls
Taqueria though, this time
Lime is what makes it

5 - La Casita
Cold Limonade
Served near the end of the ride
Tastes like delicious

6 - Pacific Beach
The sand put out front
Not a beach but lends flavor
Building colorful

7 - Corner Brewery
Drunk Munks await us
T-shirts, cards and sitting down
I want a nap now

Finale

Taco Tour Tres
Too totally tubular
Trashes this tire

1 October 2010

A hiss, imperfect
Cups inside of it perfection
Classical records

2 October 2010

Rust red staining ground
Where a metal pylon strains
Holding back the sky

3 October 2010

What beaten springs up
Stronger than just laying there?
Egg whites become foam

4 October 2010

A glass jar holding
Tasty fermented delight
Kimchi, I salute!

5 October 2010

Round becomes angles
Smooth fractures, jagged edges
Once high breaks down low

6 October 2010

On the nightstand tall
Casting beams into the night
Lamp, keep shining on

7 October 2010

With a rental car
I feel the urge to pack like
I am invading

8 October 2010

Pounds of Chinese food
More than any one can eat
Neat rows in the fridge

9 October 2010

The store of Norsemen
Providing weird glowy things
The perfect present

10 October 2010

On the stage lights dim
In the spotlight two people
Say important things

11 October 2010

Fancy rental car
Makes me feel like an asshole
And gets bad milage

12 October 2010

Just a few days gone
Yet discombobulation
Rears its fuzzy head

13 October 2010

The brain, warmed by thought
The buzz of research humming
Spent, grinds to a halt 

14 October 2010

What a vast network
Subterranean, gurgling
Just to get water

15 October 2010

After a long wait
I'm staying where I'm at now
Instead of Pittsburgh

16 October 2010

Once state of the art
This tiny box obsolete
TI-85

17 October 2010

Where did you come from?
Little tack sits on the floor
Causes big ruckus

18 October 2010

Focus emerges
Productive, but a down side
A back full of knots

19 October 2010

My old nemsis
Alarm clock, never happy
Strident tones rebuke

20 October 2010

Dusty smokey crunch
Rustling in the wind, stops
Wet earthy blanket

21 October 2010

Unflinching, the Moon
Outshines even the street lights
Its beam cold like night

22 October 2010

In cold, clarity
The sky opens, stars shine true
Nature glares baldly

23 October 2010

Fog and laser lights
In an overabundance
Lead to a headache

24 October 2010

When exercise has
Doughnuts, cider and a beer
Sign me up for it!

25 October 2010

The sleep tyranny
A doze haze approaching turns
Awake, not asleep

26 October 2010

The warnings better
Than the storms that they announced
Mother Nature fails

27 October 2010

Pithy sayings stuck
Upon the bumpers of cars
Just do not make sense

28 October 2010

Dancing in the night
Body tired, brain awake
The bed my dance floor

29 October 2010

Like a forest gone
A clean-shaven face is cold
Bare to all nature

30 October 2010

From the library
Night of the Living Tread Five
Zooms into the night

31 October 2010

A strange urge pops up
Make the apartment cleaner
Fall days bring strange thoughts

1 November 2010

A trumpet sounds out
Faintly, behind a window
I can hear its call

2 November 2010

A grate in the curb
Hiding fantastic secrets
In its murky depths

3 November 2010

A dense pancake
Flat in the street, covering
Places I can't go

4 November 2010

Standing in the wind
Bravely pointing out the way
I salute you, sign!

5 November 2010

An ominous eye
Balefully glaring in red
Warns you not to go

6 November 2010

Cold morning, early
Pastel clouds spray through the sky
Happy with the Sun

7 November 2010

Gumption lost, naps win
Warm bed a powerful draw
To hide from the world

8 November 2010

Constant confounding
The knot that's untyable
What did I sleep on?

9 November 2010

Haze glowing brightly
An alien glow abounds
With time, burns away

10 November 2010

Old maps tell stories
The lines become story arcs
Place a dialog

11 November 2010

Where did you come from?
Bombastic sneeze, blowing up
A small hurricane

12 November 2010

Forced into a store
Errands expose me to cheer
I hate holidays

13 November 2010

O happy jingle!
Go to pizza! To pizza!
The oven is done.

14 November 2010

While you must balance
In some sloth, serenity
The sweet lazy joy

15 November 2010

Slow and steady wins
But life often ends up here:
Quick burst --- then nothing

16 November 2010

The patter of rain
Syncopates with the dryers
Wet, dry, together

17 November 2010

Does it overflow?
Or, it half empty, half full
The cup, confounding

18 November 2010

The fork, metal hand
Stabbing everything in sight
Tines: two, three or four

19 November 2010

The knife is edgy
Small, large, curvy or pointy
Ready to cut you

20 November 2010

The spoon's graceful arcs
A concavity holding 
Nestled in the bowl

21 November 2010

Forget not the plate!
Brave, strong, holding up in need
It gives you plenty

22 November 2010

Holidays looming
I'm so glad for a short week
Plenty of napping

23 November 2010

Awash with good food
Thanksgiving ideas erupt
Tasty times to come

24 November 2010

Why work today?
Holidays, nothing gets done
Just biding my time

25 November 2010

Lord of the Rings Day
Food, videos and napping
A glorious time

26 November 2010

Amazing movies
Available anytime
I love the future

27 November 2010

Outside, biting wind
Against the window it slams
Warmth keeps it at bay

28 November 2010

Details unnoticed
A corner of a painting
Shines in a new light

29 November 2010

Awake way too late
Tomorrow a tired day
But it awakes joy

30 November 2010

In warmth, happiness
The faint breath of the furnace
Lulling me to sleep

1 December 2010

Where did this year go?
It's already December.
Can we add a month?

2 December 2010

Clear complexity
From simple things comes chaos
Of absurd degree

3 December 2010

The weekend, heavy
Full of opportunities
Work, or do nothing?

4 December 2010

So much left to do
Before the year is finished
Let's get down to work!

5 December 2010

Cold window, drafty
Hot chocolate keeps me warm
Safe from outside chill

6 December 2010

In a river, mud
Squishing ooze between our toes
Baked, hard under feet

7 December 2010

Snap into focus ---
Work drawn out, now aligning,
Fuzzy outlines sharp

8 December 2010

A bean, kidney red
Swimming in a sauce piquant
Luscious over rice

9 December 2010

Ascending the stairs
The people turn, and look back
Before they go in

10 December 2010

Purple, like eggplant,
Great shiny orb, softly sits.
Why is it tasty?

11 December 2010

Torchlight procession
The threat of impending rain
The most fun ever

12 December 2010

Winter's grey rainfalls
Dampen ground still unfrozen
Faint pitter-patter

13 December 2010

I've become proficient
Tearing apart my car dash
I need a new car

14 December 2010

Neologisms
Sometimes just fall from my mouth
Self dictionary

15 December 2010

Hip cats swing coolly
While jazz heats up the night air
In red, she dances

16 December 2010

Registration grooves
Laser cut in metal cold
Line up to measure

17 December 2010

A great disturbance
As if a trillion atoms
Became a taco

18 December 2010

Branding: disturbing
Cacophony of nonsense 
Tell me what you do

19 December 2010

Where did the time go?
There is so much left to do.
The end is nearing.

20 December 2010

Holding on the phone
Christmas music assaults me
My ears aren't jolly

21 December 2010

Last work day this year
Absolutely nothing done
Counting down hours

22 December 2010

Running all around
End of the year errands done
I hope for quiet

23 December 2010

Up at ass thirty
Stuffed into a tiny tube
Zooming through the air

24 December 2010

A day of nothing
I rejoice at sluggardness
Then take one more nap

25 December 2010

Eating too much food
Means yet another nap time
Man, life is sure hard

26 December 2010

Hidden in daylight
Fog fills the land, softness reigns
And the world is small

27 December 2010

Glorious beauty
Back where there is real coffee
I weep with pure joy

28 December 2010

Glorious nothing
A week bare, nothing to do
Now what shall I do?

29 December 2010

Be out and about
Sometimes I want that, others
I hole up at home

30 December 2010

Sleeping wrong, my neck
Planning assassination
I need a new bed

31 December 2010

The washer, spinning
Like the Earth, new year soon
And here I launder

1 January 2011

A new year opens
And a feeling, life is great
Occupies my mind

2 January 2011

The prospect of work
A dull cloud filling my mind
More vacation, please

3 January 2011

Piles of e-mail
An inexorable push
Of glaciers of words

4 January 2011

A facturing dish
Slipping from my hands does not
Make it to freedom

5 January 2011

It's available
But can it be workable?
I hate this software

6 January 2011

This table feels weird
A spot, unusual seat
Not normally here

7 January 2011

Falling into space
Stare at the sky hard enough
And you start to float

8 January 2011

Let's watch a movie!
Which one? Theater? Stay home?
The choice is too much.

9 January 2011

Piles of reading
Are simultaneously
Joyous and stressful

10 January 2011

Damn the torpedos!
Full speed ahead! makes me sad
When will I say that?

11 January 2011

With a bang! Awake.
What insidious person
Thought up alarm clocks?

12 January 2011

Newspapers stacked high
But seemingly never read
Who's printing this stuff?

13 January 2011

The doughnut craving \\
Is strongest in the morning \\
But comes anytime

14 January 2011

Roads naught but potholes
Asphalt skin cracked and broken
Bumpy ride indeed

15 January 2011

An idealized tree
One limb stretching to the sky
No leaves but wires

16 January 2011

I feel very warm
Yet I am not on fire
This robe is toasty

17 January 2011

Dark when I leave work
A winter storm is rolling
In the sky above

18 January 2011

Templeton's dried out
Leaves a glorious smell that
I don't want to wash

19 January 2011

A commentator
Bloviating on TV
Twenty dollar word

20 January 2011

A life of leisure
Would it manage to fulfill?
Or be just boring?

21 January 2011

A few steps by foot
Cover miles on the train
Jump between cities

22 January 2011

A dark room, music
A wall of sound envelopes
The room closes in

23 January 2011

More wandering done
With the walking I've done here
My legs are talking

24 January 2011

Midnight, I'm awake
Here in the Amtrak parking
My car, though, is not

25 January 2011

Gumption block: broken!
Pissed off enough, I march down
And buy a new car

26 January 2011

At night I gather
Food for the upcomming week
I like shopping late

27 January 2011

Cold and slushy ground
Squishing below feet frozen
A chill, cuts the air

28 January 2011

Blocking, non-blocking
Bits on the wire messy
Must kick, extra hard

29 January 2011

Microscopic view
Zeroed in, tunnel vision
Miss the big picture

30 January 2011

Feh, pizza again
The lack of gumption leads to
The easy dinner

31 January 2011

Snowpocalypse looms
At the store, people circle
Descending on food

Bonus: 

Spider Monkey/Monkeys:

Never trust monkeys!                                                                                                      
Oh Grandfather, why did I                                                                                                 
Doubt your sage advice?                                                                                                   

LASERS:

Light monotonic
Cohesion interrupted
Red mist of brain goo

Poor GPS directions:

Turn left. No! turn right!                                                                                                
Tiny map and grating voice---                                                                                             
Sends me off a cliff!

Spontaneous Human Combustion:

Getting hot in here
You feel hot? No? I feel hot.
Flee! I'm on FIRE!

1 February 2011

City reflecting
Sodium orange in the snow
Warm glow in cold skies

2 February 2011

Whiny singing drones
As I pass a house walking
I quicken my pace

3 February 2011

A pathetic beach
Sand grains on the welcome mat
Grate, do not relax

4 February 2011

Refraining refrains
Render rhymes ridiculous
Really required

5 February 2011

Seeking salvation
Some squander serenity
Some society

6 February 2011

This theme thoroughly
Transcends the taste thoughtfulness
Therefore, this time: halt

7 February 2011

Fibonacci scribes
A series ever closer
Golden ratio

8 February 2011

Originator
The birthplace of lies hidden
Unsuspectingly

9 February 2011

Goofy Kroger rice \\
Nearly all done, some still raw \\
How does that happen?

10 February 2011

Leftovers combine
A strange ad-hoc mixing dish
Turns out pretty good

11 February 2011

You're ever so vain.
Probably think this haiku's
About you, don't you?

12 February 2011

Gallons of Chili
I just wanted to test it
But did it in full

13 February 2011

Chopping out the waste
One's waste, another's treasure
Makes things difficult

14 February 2011

Early Spring preview
A strong urge to shed jackets
Looking for tree buds

15 February 2011

Visualize calm
Let your mind empty as a
Leaf floats on the wind

16 February 2011

Repository
That's taking so long to clone
I am impatient

17 February 2011

Day after dinner
I'm still full around lunch time
Really ate too much

18 February 2011

Cold dread, panicing
A stupid mistake, coursing
Chilling all my blood

19 February 2011

A job done early
Makes me spend Saturday night
At work, not Sunday

20 February 2011

The campaign for spring
Sweet flowers, ideas planted
Struggling to bloom

21 February 2011

Barnacles of snow
Crusted on automobiles
Winter's last hurrah

22 February 2011

Itch unscratchable
An insolence maddening
Small nit magnified

23 February 2011

Now wasting my time
Learning nothing new, sleepy,
I yearn for coffee

24 February 2011

Jargon's fake patois
Rendering unreadable
Things I will ignore

25 February 2011

Fire seducing
Rapt attention, indoor coals
Window keeps alive

26 February 2011

Acres of clothing
Endless yards to look through
To find just one thing

27 February 2011

End-of-month pizza
The conjection of gumption
And few groceries

28 February 2011

Dominated by slush
A helpful sign, spring awakens?
Will it be here soon?

1 March 2011

Like desperate hands
Errant branches spring from earth
Straining for the sky

2 March 2011

Woke up too early
Brain is still off, not thinking
A fog of tired

3 March 2011

People cannot drive
Like idiots, dumbfounded
Two ton missiles

4 March 2011

From behind my eye
Dull throbbing resonating
Ruining my day

5 March 2011

A green hat, bobbing,
Dashing past the front window
Disappears from sight

6 March 2011

Castles floating high
Soaring only from anchors
Buried in the ground

7 March 2011

A craving for peas
Delicate green orbs, tiny
Sweet bursts of flavor

8 March 2011

A mighty ocean
Bestrode by a titan tall
Boy plays in the mud

9 March 2011

Rock and roll music?
It is too loud. Soft music,
A nice polka, no?

10 March 2011

Beware, Tens of March
What, ides? What the hell are ides?
Where is that memo?

11 March 2011

What's beyond that grove?
Over that hill? Down that path?
With walking you learn

12 March 2011

Why do you rumble?
You should be happy, tummy,
So why are you sad?

13 March 2011

Turn and turn again
In a tight spiral we go
Waiting in a line

14 March 2011

Numbers all lined up
Attempting to find order
In the data sea

15 March 2011

Cautiously, green buds
Emerge from brown earth, peeking
Is it the right time?

16 March 2011

From good comes evil
Wholesomeness plus deep fryer
Oh what have we wraught?

17 March 2011

Windows opening
Letting the first real Spring in
Breeze removes Winter

18 March 2011

Ominous grumbles
Calling out from my tummy
Why are you so sad?

19 March 2011

Little old lady
Driving a tiny car --- zoom!
Gliding down the street

20 March 2011

Mega power nap
Four hours long --- impressive
Even I respect

21 March 2011

Thirty-six hours
Stuck inside my apartment
I'm glad to get out

22 March 2011

Tiny ice nuggets
Not even grains of rice size
Weak slush from above

23 March 2011

Infinite Tacos
Not just a buffet item
But a good band name

24 March 2011

I'm an idiot!
That box, my toe, late at night
Curse the sky above

25 March 2011

My late night reading
Lately, technical papers
I dream protocols

26 March 2011

Long and winding path
As of now, barren and grey
But spring! Spring come soon

27 March 2011

Forgotten noodles
Did not get put in spring rolls
I'm an idiot

28 March 2011

Entropy for real
A neat stack of news papers
Meets a windy breeze

29 March 2011

Where the seasons go
Once anticipatory
Yet fleeting they go

30 March 2011

The bald sun, staring
Glaring sternly down on us
Unimpressed, snarky

31 March 2011

These pants shed cat hair
But I don't own a damn cat
Stupid static sucks

1 April 2011

Today, more stupid
The internet outshines
I hate this damn day

2 April 2011

On days like today
I just want the Talking Heads
Playing all day long

3 April 2011

How are you purple?
Oh eggplant, what a strange hue
You flash on the shelf

4 April 2011

A cave never seen
In a mountain never climbed
Waterfall keeps guard

5 April 2011

Meetings too early
Fill with an infinite rage
There were no doughnuts

6 April 2011

Glowing rectangle
As an omen in the night
Advertising gas

7 April 2011

Old man, shouting phone
Recipe for fried chicken
I cross the street here

8 April 2011

Beacon calling out
``Hey, there's something tall right here!"
Flash red, stay away

9 April 2011

Ypsi universe
It's potholes all the way down
Holes have holes have holes

10 April 2011

Walking, strut my stuff
One may think I'm so strung out
Blister in the Sun

11 April 2011

Oh glorious day
I revel in you, so good
This day makes me grin   

12 April 2011

Hate golden arches
But now, still craving french fries
I go to the store

13 April 2011

The mind, exhausted
Refused to go to sleep
Stab with a q-tip....

14 April 2011

Extinguisher sign
Yet no red can sits nearby
Shun fire safety

15 April 2011

Lots of whoas and raas
Something about bad romance
Leave my head, Gaga

16 April 2011

Car, special powers
Mission from God: save orphans
Brothers bring the blues

17 April 2011

After a long nap
Energy for big cleaning
Okay, medium....

18 April 2011

Rambling about things
Hopefully my training talk
Made a bit of sense

19 April 2011

My ears still fuzzy
I did rock, and having rocked
I go home to sleep

20 April 2011

Going dodo's way
This technology, creaking
Still sputters along

21 April 2011

Shift: green, yellow, red
Idols in the sky, flashing
Governing our lives

22 April 2011

The little pothole
I walk past everyday
Keep up! You'll make it!

23 April 2011

A glorious day
The sky blue, a few clouds fly
High as my spirits

24 April 2011

How restful, the nap
The day calm, breezes lulling
Singing me to sleep

25 April 2011

Awaken early
Ready for the week ahead
What the hell is this?

26 April 2011

Morning haze glowing
Fades, growing calm, then bursting
As the Sun leaps up

27 April 2011

Staring does not lead
To a building falling down;
Mightily I try

28 April 2011

Half a day at work
Compliments of DTE
Can't keep the lights on

29 April 2011

Why thank you, Winter
For inflicting upon me
One last head cancer

30 April 2011

What color is this
The snot falling from my head
Unusual hue

1 May 2011

Where's my Wobbly pin?
The day I want to wear it
I can't find the thing

2 May 2011

Why, deviled eggs, why?
In my thoughts at 2 a.m.
You poison my mind

3 May 2011

When did that happen?
I forget not just comings
But things that occured

4 May 2011

Oh, how I miss thee
The famed Veggie Super Dog
You are far away

5 May 2011

A soft glow, bright flare
White curls up, becomes grey
Words lost by fire

6 May 2011

And now what movie?
But that just sounds boring
Too many choices

7 May 2011

These bits don't mean that
Something else entirely
And now I'm confused

8 May 2011

How did this week fill?
Things to do every night
Means a busy life

9 May 2011

The awesome driver
Finds late night Mexican food
A post Gigi's trip

10 May 2011

The thought of breakfast
Weighing heavily, a pause---
Lunch time already

11 May 2011

The Sun and my bed
Should not be near each other
Curse the morning light

12 May 2011

Wee little quinoa
When cooked, tiny tails pop out
Indicate doneness

13 May 2011

Flaming Lips rock out
At the Filmore Theater
After, veggie dog

14 May 2011

New career perhaps?
Tend bar at boss' party
Cute gay guys give tips

15 May 2011

The lure of laundry
A faint, distant siren song
Defeated by sloth

16 May 2011

Some talk of robots ---
Silent on killer lasers
What nonsense is this?

17 May 2011

Long walk in the rain
Washing all my thoughts away
The world is all right

18 May 2011

Let the mind empty
And there, in the void, calmly:
Just dream of tacos

19 May 2011

``Why yes, that's heavy"
Screaming, my big toe whimpers
Stupid bulky box

20 May 2011

A brilliant moon glows
A luminous cave of clouds
Providing a home

21 May 2011

To north Michigan
Or at least heading that way
Mt. Pleasant training

22 May 2011

At long last it ends
Weeks of business over
Now: not a damn thing

23 May 2011

Ersatz wishing well
Will pennies fill this pot hole?
My mission: find out

24 May 2011

A search for lilac
Mind thinks it's where it isn't
Going in circles

25 May 2011

Bright yellow dry shell
Like a beacon, defiant
Grey rain batters in

26 May 2011

I stare, things make sense
I start to write them down so
They keep making sense

27 May 2011

Twelve-thousand days here
Seems more memorable than
A once a year thing

28 May 2011

The air, growing still
No longer cools; I relent:
Air conditioning

29 May 2011

Thunder strikes nearby
The pool, still cold, could use it
Instead, we grill out

30 May 2011

Alone at the Mug
An iced Americano
Is my company

31 May 2011

`How?' is the question
Stuck at the top of the queue
`When?' will come later

1 June 2011

Summer's sweet perfume
Floats below the clear blue sky
Intoxicating

2 June 2011

The signal is low
Causing glitches and pauses
Need a new AP

3 June 2011

Somewhere are staples
In a pile, I see them
But where's the pile?

4 June 2011

Wander for hours
Then Robyn singing at me
Really makes the day

5 June 2011

Eight billion degrees
Or at least it feels like it
Why is it so hot?

6 June 2011

Robots are coming
Their spinny arms set to kill
Water will save us

7 June 2011

Whinging behind me
Ruins my coffee shop chill
Just shut up there, dude

8 June 2011

In a room, I learn
A dude in Salt Lake City
Making slides go by

9 June 2011

Files uploading
Bits are taking forever
Give me more pipe, yo

10 June 2011

Impromptu stir-fry
After hours of chatting
Ties off the evening

11 June 2011

Toothpaste and apples
Teach about taste perception
Plus, there is coffee

12 June 2011

Why do anything?
It is Sunday, take a nap.
And have some pizza.

13 June 2011

Fifteen types of gin
I don't think we are lacking
Perhaps it's too much

14 June 2011

Simple evening walk
As the world rushes by me
Move at my own pace

15 June 2011

Layers peeling back
The asphalt of years gone by
Ground up with much noise

16 June 2011

Buzzing bumblebees
Bouncing between bright blossoms
Become boisterous

17 June 2011

Surreal and sublime?
Or self-pretentious bullshit?
Not sure, this movie

18 June 2011

Lazy summer day
And the bus passes, slowly
Waste no energy

19 June 2011

Bike grease on my hands
Worn like a badge of honor
Also, that's weak soap

20 June 2011

There will be clean clothes
Quarters, soap, time and gumption
I sit while it spins

21 June 2011

The urge for counting
Is tempered by too much stuff
Waiting for counting

22 June 2011

Middle of the week
And the end, too far away
Grumble to myself

23 June 2011

I can not name it
But the color on that car
Is simply awful

24 June 2011

Some things make no sense
Like this stupid code, broken
In some stupid way

25 June 2011

Never seen this big
A movie watched in new light
Khaaaaaaan, one syllable

26 June 2011

Sabotage myself
With a bent fork, I'm flying
Sadly, no good scars

27 June 2011

Like the sands of time
With pressure, rocks become sand
Its passage softens

28 June 2011

I see skies of blue
Making me want to sing of
A wonderful world

29 June 2011

Such a tiny thing
A furious little sun
My laptop, too warm

30 June 2011

Stupid vendors are
Just me repeating myself
I hate all of them

1 July 2011

O Canada Day!
I celebrate with poutine
And Moxy Fruvous

2 July 2011

Ten hours, and five
Driving, time in Grand Rapids
Hang out with zine friends

3 July 2011

Why two pounds of peas?
Why not use three pounds of peas?
That sounds good to me. 

4 July 2011

Could the pea salad
Just not want to get eaten?
Damn food poisoning

5 July 2011

This day, sleepy haze
And no appetite, defined
It passes quickly

6 July 2011

That color is blue.
I don't care for fancy names,
That color is blue.

7 July 2011

Where are your headlights?
Cars coming at me should be
Very brightly lit.

8 July 2011

There, a blinkylight
Let's the world know something {\em is}
Does anyone see?

9 July 2011

Craving some baked goods
I have an oatmeal muffin
Tasty and fiber

10 July 2011

I hate buying shoes
They never have what I want
This goes for clothes too

11 July 2011

A crack in the sky
Losing their bottoms, the clouds
Rain down upon us

12 July 2011

As I leave, mats come
Much work when I get back here
But now, conference

13 July 2011

A book warrior
Devoutly guards his building
No unknowns will pass

14 July 2011

Late walk, Central Park
City explodes above me
I am mesmerised

15 July 2011

Delta: Always late
Chillin' at Newark Airport
What more can I say?

16 July 2011

Twelve hours of heat
Shadow Art Fair at Corner
Luckily there's beer

17 July 2011

Oversleep, Mom calls,
I get out of bed, craving
Waffles with syrup

18 July 2011

Concur travel thing
Must be written by morons
Who thought this was good?

19 July 2011

Why call it hanger?
It doesn't hang anything,
It should be hunger.

20 July 2011

State College PA
In the middle of nowhere
Surrounded by hills

21 July 2011

Back in NYC
I can't wait to explore here
If just a few days

22 July 2011

Old subway station
A museum to the past
Trains make me happy

23 July 2011

Davey Wavey sits
Beside an ancient needle
Roasting in the sun

24 July 2011

A Manhattan pit
Is famous for bike polo
I visit with folks

25 July 2011

I'm on a ferry!
To each borough I journey
And then get coffee

26 July 2011

Last walk, Central Park
Retrieve my car, New Jersey
And start the ride home

27 July 2011

The journey a week
Twelve-hundred fifty miles
What a time it was

28 July 2011

My house a right mess
But I'm still on vacation
So who gives a fuck?

29 July 2011

A lazy morning
A quiet lunch at Beezy's
Ugly Mug, then nap

30 July 2011

Plans for these last days
Foolishly made; why did I
Think they would get done?

31 July 2011

Try to do dishes
Getting through the stacking phase
I fail at washing

1 August 2011

Awake? This hour?
What nonsense must I suffer?
Going to work sucks

2 August 2011

Printmaking research
Always at the last minute
Will I get this done?

3 August 2011

In my apartment
I have a tool to fix that
If I can find it

4 August 2011

We are all star stuff
Ancient bits became our lives
It's why I don't dust

5 August 2011

Tiny little box
Grabs interent from the air
And gives it to me

6 August 2011

Slot for everything
And everything in its slot
A box full of books

7 August 2011

Hate being meta
But what I hate even more
Is meta meta

8 August 2011

In a tiny cup
Is a tiny coffee drink
Oh, Macchiato

9 August 2011

Off in the distance
I hear a trumpet playing
It's eight a.m., dude

10 August 2011

Fastest thing ever
Bends in the presence of glass
A strange world it is

11 August 2011

Craving apple juice
A late night trip to the store
You are weird, stomach

12 August 2011

Counting down minutes
A slow night, then reading
Relax before bed

13 August 2011

Deny miracles?
Then consider ranch dressing.
Where did that come from?

14 August 2011

Bending, yet stays straight
Coiled tension holds my place
Spring closes the door

15 August 2011

A shoe, tells my toe,
``I wouldn't stub you if you
sometime cleaned this place."

16 August 2011

The lure of French fries
Coming strong at three o'clock
Is sadly ignored

17 August 2011

Mailbox guardians
A spider watches letters ---
I cannot dislodge

18 August 2011

Honk In honk the honk
Distance honk a honk car honk
Alarm honk goes honk

19 August 2011

What short life, the leaf
Factories of chlorophyll
Trees breathe so we breathe

20 August 2011

Outside: loud people
Students must be returning
Get out of my town

21 August 2011

At just the wrong time
The front door and my knee meet
Not a happy time

22 August 2011

Who is the Speed Queen?
In the Laundromat Kingdom,
Does she reign supreme?

23 August 2011

A puzzle revealed
When I have an espresso
I love you, caffeine

24 August 2011

Light beam, diffraction
Bits of glass reveal color
White becomes multi

25 August 2011

Packing is easy
When you don't think about it
Just throw stuff in bag

26 August 2011

The land of Des Plaines
The smell of pizza wafting
Making me hungry

27 August 2011

Iowa: Surprise!
Mom can't believe that I'm here
Happy birthday, aunt

28 August 2011

Cleaning up today
Party debris from last night
The cake is all gone

29 August 2011

Iowa, Chicago
Stop at Wormhole for coffee
Then Ypsilanti

30 August 2011

Another day gone
As the Sun sets in the west
I go for a walk

31 August 2011

Very flimsy chair
Lawn furniture, laundromat
A picnic, with clothes

1 Sept 2011

One, single digit
Keeps multipliers the same
To build more, just add

2 Sept 2011

Two, doubling power
Binary's simple basis
Only even prime

3 Sept 2011

Times for luck, at bat
Three legs on a stool keeps you
From falling over

4 Sept 2011

Corners of the earth
From there four winds blowing forth
Swaying the grasses

5 Sept 2011

This song in my head
Has been going all morning
Will it ever stop?

6 Sept 2011

The whirr of a fan
Complimenting a soft breeze
Putting me to sleep

7 Sept 2011

The smell of chalk dust
Bringing back fond memories
Daydreaming of school

8 Sept 2011

Office vent like jet
A constant background droning
Scares me when it stops

9 Sept 2011

Rustle above me
Birds are in the eaves again
Twitter merrily

10 Sept 2011

Toucan Sam waves hi
Smiling on my coffee mug
Is this brew fruity?

11 Sept 2011

This code is hacky
Somehow, though, I made it work
Surprised me to hell

12 September 2011

New job accepted
I go to New York City
Now I have to move

13 September 2011

Lined up in a row
Quarters make the washer go
Making my clothes clean

14 September 2011

Thank you, scratchy throat
You make me sound like a frog
Amputate, I say

15 September 2011

Still in my cupboard
Aluminum foil roll
From the Ames HyVee

16 September 2011

Flickering light bulb
How you make me hate this place
Pick on or off, please

17 September 2011

Think apple cider
Remember cider doughnuts
Sigh a happy sigh

18 September 2011

Boxes still unpacked
From the last move, throw away
I don't need that stuff

19 September 2011

Harder than I thought:
Getting rid of a new car
Must go: Ohio

20 September 2011

Thousands of details
Overwhelm a puny mind
Checklist sanity

21 September 2011

Online newspapers
Have but one cardinal rule:
Never read comments

22 September 2011

Flashing lights go by
And the siren draws like I'm
Still a little kid

23 September 2011

Staring at the sky
Don't know what I'm looking for
Perhaps it's nothing

24 September 2011

Staring at fire
The glow of embers soothes me
Simple happiness

25 September 2011

Connections pay off
A cousin in NYC
Gives apartment leads

26 September 2011

The thought of dishes
Filling with a sense of dread
Do them already

27 September 2011

Here I come, New York
I'm going to find a place
Get out of my way

28 September 2011

Hours of walking
Trying to find a new home
Up and down we go

29 September 2011

Large sums of money
If you want an apartment
Make my account pale

30 September 2011

An apartment found
I breathe a sigh of relief
And sleep more soundly

1 October 2011

At Fort Tryon Park
Overlooking the Hudson
The air flows cooly

2 October 2011

Paint of the ages
Softens a bolt's hard edges
Layers make hard soft

3 October 2011

A plan is thwarted
By a card found expired
Columbus later

4 October 2011

Brain dump commencing
Can I write down all I know?
It's time to find out

5 October 2011

Seek apple cider
I have too little of it
And I must fix that

6 October 2011

Intense sleepyness
Too much food and a good beer
Bring the land of nod

7 October 2011

A quiet night in
Plan on getting up early
Muting the night time

8 October 2011

From shelves to boxes
A truck driven far away
My books will come back

9 October 2011

Interrogation
But at least a friendly one
Because there was beer

10 October 2011

Such a tiny box
In it hours of music
I love the future

11 October 2011

I need some more tape
Yet another thing to go
On my to do list

12 October 2011

Ohio Time Warp
Three hours to Columbus
But five hours back

13 October 2011

How did you get here
Wee bug crawling on my desk?
Time for you to go.

14 October 2011

Bye computer junk
You've filled this garage for years
Now you're recycled

15 October 2011

An uneasy dread:
Did you forget something, or
Forget you forgot?

16 October 2011

Eat way too much food
Canadian Thanksgiving
Held a week later

17 October 2011

Last minute papers
I think I have them all done
Better double-check

18 October 2011

Boxes consume me
Stacks of them, piled on high
Taunting, mocking me

19 October 2011

Not much to do here
My office packed and empty
The last day of work

20 October 2011

No work today, but
Still have to get up early
Come soon, November

21 October 2011

I am out of room
Packing will have to resume
When more stuff is gone

22 October 2011

Giant and yellow
Lumbering beast growls and starts
A vast moving truck

23 October 2011

Now is not the time
Sleeping in can come next week
For now, we must work

24 October 2011

The list is shrinking
I'm sure it will grow again
But for now, smaller

25 October 2011

Last minutes consume
A clock, winding down faster
As time passes by

26 October 2011

The big yellow truck
Rolling down the road; New York ---
What I'm aiming for

27 October 2011

This journey ending
Sooner than I expected.
Sleep in my new home

28 October 2011

License, PO Box
Running all over the place
Then I take a nap

29 October 2011

Sorting the boxes
Into the rooms they'll go in
Enough for today

30 October 2011

Eating out too much
I unpack the kitchen and
Find a grocery store

31 October 2011

No one at my door
Means the candy is all mine.
Muahahahaha

1 November 2011

The list grows longer
Of things I must go pick up
This weekend, the store

2 November 2011

Hear the traffic go
Even at night, the city
Moves with urgency

3 November 2011

Sink faucet, dripping
Handle's delicate dancing 
Try to make it stop

4 November 2011

Like a child, lost
Had that pen for many months
Used it, forgot it

5 November 2011

The gnome grows absurd
Without a lawn, it suffers
By a flower pot

6 November 2011

That lamp works, makes light
The switch, broken, always on
Useless, not enough

7 November 2011

Under dark corners
The dust of a thousand years
Silently waiting

8 November 2011

New box of paper
What joy will you bring to us
Five thousand canvas

9 November 2011

Apartment basement
Holding many secret things
I seek the laundry

10 November 2011

Gas hisses. Release.
Chilled water and a few shakes.
Press lever for fun.

11 Novemeber 2011

One hundred year grime
Tunnels the color of mud
Grease and gunk built up

12 November 2011

With a wary eye
At the apartment fuse box
Plugging more stuff in

13 November 2011

How long did that take
Weird scaly thing up above
Found in my bathroom

14 November 2011

There, dully thudding
A monster behind my eyes
Begone, foul demon

15 November 2011

The simple joy found
When I can walk to errands
During my lunch break

16 November 2011

Spy a lonely bench
Huddled alone by a light
Nobody sitting

17 November 2011

Subterranean
Highways, stretching the city
Going here and there

18 November 2011

Yearning of a tree
To feel sunlight and water
It bends, so slowly

19 November 2011

Not broken, just off
A few fine adjustments fix
What was once rubbish

20 November 2011

A slip, and it breaks
Shards of glass, the kitchen sink
Shoulda bought plastic

21 November 2011

Like a hug, reverse
A towel fresh from the dryer
Wrapped bundle of warmthh

22 November 2011

Done now with shopping
And I should put things away
Recliner beckons

23 November 2011

Anticipation
Giddy thoughts growing, waiting
Release an idea

24 November 2011

Planing for the day
Lots of food, taking some naps
And Lord of the Rings

25 November 2011

Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
What the hell is wrong with you
Why do you hate me, back?

26 November 2011

Out of bed today
For maybe twenty minutes
I curse all pinched nerves

27 November 2011

Stuck in bed all day
Isn't as fun as it sounds
Some day I'll get up

28 November 2011

To the door! Made it!
The journey to work and back
An epic mission

29 November 2011

A quiet globe glows
Casting light upon the ground
A tree loses leaves

30 November 2011

Always crave pizza
I should be eating healthy
But there's pizza, man

1 December 2011

One month of work down
And still, nothing on fire
Doing pretty good

2 December 2011

Two more book cases
Should take the slack most nicely
Furniture run soon

3 December 2011

I like this table
Where I can work and look out
On the street below

4 December 2011

In a dark corner
A book I knew I had hides
Until I clean up

5 December 2011

Over a month here
And I still haven't put up
Any posters yet

6 December 2011

That lamp's not broken!
It just needed adjustment.
And I feel crafty

7 December 2011

In bed with a book
A soft light glowing; I read
And then I doze off

8 December 2011

Rusty balcony
The fire escape is tempting
But I don't go out

9 December 2011

Why do I want plants?
I never take care of them,
And then they all die

10 December 2011

Almost the whole list
Except for the one thing that
I really did need

11 December 2011

Say, who was that man,
Who first put the bomp in the
Bomp-she-bomp-she-bomp?

12 December 2011

Subway lady lies
The train two stations away
For fifteen minutes

13 Decembmer 2011

Glorious soup pot
A simmering tasty stew
Goes in my belly

14 December 2011

I found what I lost
When I put something away
Where it was to go

15 December 2011

This window, dirty
Is almost uncleanable
Without anti-grav

16 December 2011

The parties at a
Private university 
Can be pretty swank

17 December 2011

Ancient memories
FORTRAN 77
It's out of my brain

18 December 2011

Thwoomp thwoomp thwoomp thwoomp eetz
Boom eetz eetz eetz boom boom boom
Techno in my head

19 December 2011

Oranges blossoming
A faint mist, a citrus breeze
The peel is shredded

20 December 2011

The winter so far
Has been a pretty tame one
No snow makes me sad

21 December 2011

Random wisps of steam
Escape a grate in the street
The engine moves on

22 December 2011

Holiday party
Leftovers lead to grazing
Be still my waistline

23 December 2011

Two-thirty am
Is for still being awake
Not for awaking

24 December 2011

Toast! Let there be toast.
Some scrambled eggs would be nice.
Impromptu breakfast.

25 December 2011

Best part of Christmas
Is fresh baked cinnamon rolls
Right from the oven

26 December 2011

So glad to be gone
But the few days away and
So glad to be back

27 December 2011

Where is the tea pot?
I know I just saw it there.
No tea is madness

28 December 2011

Three days work this week
Almost doesn't seem worth it
Hopefully it flies

29 December 2011

How the time does fly
Nearly the end of the year
When did that happen?

30 December 2011

Quiet radio
A song going through my head
Over and over

31 December 2011

Opening champagne
Is best done with a big knife
I learned that this year

1 January 2012

The bare cold new year
Expectant, all before us
Twelve months with promise

2 January 2012

Vow to eat oatmeal
More fiber and nutrition
These things fill my mind

3 January 2012

The bitter Hudson
A torrent of cold air blasts
Doors of a warm place

4 January 2012

Accustomed rumble
At night, I hear the subway
Lulling me to sleep

5 January 2012

You fool many folks
With fake quote attributions.
Always works. -- Mark Twain

6 January 2012

Yearning for more sleep
Stumbling through the day, only
Wide awake at night

7 January 2012

Books of history
Of cities I no longer
Walk the streets of home

8 January 2012

A magic jar is
Necessary if you want 
To store gumptions.

9 January 2012

Look at the toothbrush
``How did it get here'', I think.
Morning, too early

10 January 2012

The battery, weak
The laptop, warning me it's
Time to go to sleep

11 January 2012

Regular craters
Containing a gooey mass
Waffles, so perfect

12 January 2012

Raspy hacking cough
Why haven't you left with the
Rest of my damn cold?

13 January 2012

With Winter so weak
I am done with it; crave Spring,
And the warmth it brings

14 January 2012

A river of air
Bracing, splashing off buildings
Birds swimming above

15 January 2012

Starting a big list:
``Things I Need To Get Rid Of"
At the top: Old Socks

16 January 2012

A list of errands
Running all over the place
Glad when it is done

17 January 2012

Wind monsters howling
Scream outside my apartment
Trying to break in

18 January 2012

From the bookcase taunts
{\em Calculus Made Easy} --- and
What I've forgotten

19 January 2012

Slowest train ever
Trudging to 168
Late to work today

20 January 2012

Standard Friday night
Movie playing, on the couch
Takeaway Chinese

21 January 2012

The ravine divides
The place where I am from the
Whiskey hot cocoa

22 January 2012

Productive cleaning
The apartment tidied up
Who the hell am I?

23 January 2012

Energy today
But will it last the whole week?
Only time will tell

24 January 2012

The dispatcher says
Stay there for a little bit---
Stand clear of the doors

25 January 2012

Like a tie-dye flag
Sharp color points in a row
Pins on a push board

26 January 2012

An old man razor
Is hard to find in this town
The blades --- everywhere

27 January 2012

How much paint? Or rust?
What is the fire escape
Really made up of?

28 January 2012

Window, just open
In sneaks the breeze, curtain flits
The wind is now seen

29 January 2012

Today I want cake
And yet there is no cake here
Where is the cake, man?

30 January 2012

In ephemera
Are stories that history
Needs to remember

31 January 2012

Glass of water full
Covers pulled back, pillow fluffed
Now it's time for bed

1 February 2012

Feb--ru {\emru} ar--y
Why is that r sitting there?
What good does it do?

2 February 2012

The first step, doozy
Playing chicken with the train
Time for some flapjacks

3 February 2012

Where did I put that?
The book was sitting right there.
Now where did it go?

4 February 2012

A little moth flies
Lazily around the room
Go out the window

5 February 2012

I must go shopping
I keep looking in the fridge
Nothing good shows up

6 February 2012

Lazily floating
Fat clouds saunter through the sky
Heavy with shadows

7 February 2012

I still don't get trees.
Like long slender hands reaching
Up to get the sky

8 February 2012

The smell of almonds
Wrapped in a sugary glaze
Tempt every night

9 February 2012

Consider numbers
And staggering at the count
Sit back, think letters

10 February 2012

You sir, with the hat
Like an old sea captain you
Command the sidewalk

11 February 2012

Glimpses of the past
Old zines, old scenes, long since past
Life a life in print

12 February 2012

An ode to Oatmeal:
Cheap, simple, easy, comfort.
In Breakfast there's Truth

13 February 2012

Ephermal smell
Paint wafting down the hall
Remodeling done

14 February 2012

I'm an idiot.
That book I was looking for?
Under some laundry.

15 February 2012

One ... two ... three ... four ... five
Numbers climb as seconds do
Six ... seven ... eight ... nine

16 February 2012

The band in my head
From Weezer to Madonna
90s night tonight

17 February 2012

Why is that word that?
Who looked at a cup and said
``We shall utter `cup'"?

18 February 2012

Low fidelity
The songs playing in my head
Up way too early

19 February 2012

Little felty pads
On the legs of kitchen chairs
Keep the floors scratch free

20 February 2012

I have defeated
The mighty LDAP, slaying
Data left and right

21 February 2012

Fast, then slow, then fast
Tuesday feels like it's Thursday
Time warping at work

22 February 2012

New Jersey sirens
Wafting across the Hudson
Is it being bombed?

23 February 2012

Winter's last breath, held ---
It's sigh, letting go, becomes
Roar of a new Spring

24 February 2012

Golden orb, bloody
Reliqishes all fluids
Moro orange for lunch

25 February 2012

Off the Atlantic
The winds rush to create swells
Rocking the ferry

26 February 2012

As boats, floating by
Yearn for distant lands; We sit
Grounded in the park

27 February 2012

Stone shoulders standing
Struggle to hold back brown earth
Grass tickles them both

28 February 2012

Pearlescent coat
Vainly tries to pretty up
The rat of the sky

29 February 2012

This day but four years
Screws my mental calendar
Why isn't it March?

1 March 2012

Piles of data
Waiting to be analyzed
Filling me with joy

2 March 2012

Groove becomes trenches
Solving a problem a fight
Mind racing, then win

3 March 2012

Dreary the gray breaks
As blue, sliding from the sky
Lights the ground below

4 March 2012

One less box around
A pale victory compared
To all the ones left

5 March 2012

Lightbulbs blowing out
Not used to that happening;
So rare now these days

6 March 2012

Flash crashing this site
Lots of sad puzzle pieces
I kick Chrome; go on

7 March 2012

Through the Fog of Code
On the other side, sitting
Pure lucidity

8 March 2012

Bright knot in my back
You have no reason to be
Go away now, please

9 March 2012

Files flashing by
As data from here to there
Shuffles through the net

10 March 2012

Strong taco cravings
Can only lead to one thing
Strong taco eating

11 March 2012

Fingernails creep me
Dead things growing from the ends---
Shit\! There's toenails too?

12 March 2012

Subway, rocking, lulls
Me with the promise of sleep
Must not fall for it

13 March 2012

Ignoble Pigeons
Divebombing, miss the sidewalk
Fly away, unmissed

14 March 2012

Do you hear the song?
Scored a million players strong
City Symphony

15 March 2012

The crave for a slice
Is a strong longing today
No pizza this week

16 March 2012

Falafel Friday
So sublime in its beauty
In purpose, noble

17 March 2012

Layers and weaving
A warm dark cave in softness
Makes a place to sleep

18 March 2012

Run out of coffee
Time to get the day going
Many things to do

19 March 2012

Quiet thoughts nagging
In the back of the head break
Through and make antsy

20 March 2012

Beware the sidewalks
Angry with all the stepping
They try to trip you

21 March 2012

Streetside sentinals
Watching you, counting seconds
Their wrath brings tickets

22 March 2012

The thunk of relays
Keeping me safe each morning
Holding back traffic

23 March 2012

Metal oracles
Divine wisdom in the air
Providing guidance

24 March 2012

Giant bee buzzing
In my living room, confused
Windows confound it

25 March 2012

Somedays, Sundays fill
With rapt productivity
That is not today

26 March 2012

Zigzag lines growing
Foreshadowing a migraine
Only a shadow

27 March 2012

I'm often surprised
At how quiet it can be
Inside the city

28 March 2012

Walking through the park
On a cool, early Spring day
The world is all right

29 March 2012

I hear a faint beep
And a forlorn buzzing sound
Coming down the street

30 March 2012

Not a welcome sound,
The motorcycle assholes
Tearing through the night

31 March 2012

Stuck here at the end
Thirty-one days passing by
Tomorrow: April

1 April 2012

When the sunny days
Turn one's thoughts to summer time
And grilling parties

2 April 2012

One does not simply
Walk calmly into Mordor ---
There's a ticket booth

3 April 2012

Double-secret? Hah!
Triple-secret probation
Is what you suffer

4 April 2012

Into a bar walk
Gatekeeper and Keymaster ---
Barkeep crosses streams

5 April 2012

Save the orphanage
Requires a car chase of
Epic proportions

6 April 2012

The list continues:
The sixteenth rule of Fight Club:
Tuesday night: tacos

7 April 2012

A fresh rain washes
Making the streets look pretty
--- maybe an hour

8 April 2012 

Useless bookcases:
Speakers I no longer use
Hold a stack of books

9 April 2012

Motorcyclists:
Most of them I'm fine with,
Asshole ones I hate

10 April 2012

Soft bean curd wallows
A fluffy cloud, salty sauce;
Tempura crunches

11 April 2012

Ominous clicking
From the radiator pipes
It stops suddenly

12 April 2012

Apartment hydra
A mess of cables growing
Knotting, and waiting

13 April 2012

Perambulating
Is the finest therapy
For a cool spring day

14 April 2012

It's $\pi + 1$ day
Any old excuse for pie
Is good in my book

15 April 2012

Dammit, now I want
Pie --- yesterday was kidding
Today it is real

16 April 2012

Where is the Thai food?
Why can't we find the Thai food?
We walked right past it.

17 April 2012

How can just one week
Turn a pretty park from plain
To lushly verdant?

18 April 2012

Brain stuck on fire
Then the afternoon fizzle
Blank stare an hour

19 April 2012

There are scissors here
I know I packed at least three
So where are they now?

20 April 2012

I need poster frames
And the abundance of choice
Is locking my brain

21 April 2012

Windows need cleaning
Which would seem to require
Rocket boots or such

22 April 2012

Bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop
My brain is not on today
So you get this junk

23 April 2012

Full of cells growing
Living, dying, dividing
Just freaking me out

24 April 2012

The flutter of birds
Quiet, peaceful and calming.
Not at five a.m.

25 April 2012

Why must you taunt me
Sugar roasted peanut guy?
You torture my day.

26 April 2012

When I am busy
The time for library books
Passes too quickly

27 April 2012

Slow, majestically
The {\em Enterprise} passes by
It's soon to be home

28 April 2012

The lure of pizza
Ever is my nemesis
Someday I will beat

29 April 2012

Why do I keep this?
It's a recipt: months ago
I bought groceries

30 April 2012

Is it a cliche
To wonder where the month went?
It happens often.

1 May 2012

Walking down Broadway
A few thousand friends in tow
Making me feel good

2 May 2012

I hear a faint call
Tom Collins in the distance
I wait for summer

3 May 2012

That cucumber has
Been in the fridge for too long
Into the garbage

4 May 2012

Hurried, in three stores
To find the stuff to make pie
I am exhausted

5 May 2012

Cinco de Mayo
Seems weird until I think of
The Fourth of July

6 May 2012

Blankets, what a word
Even the name feels like it
Wraps you in a hug

7 May 2012

More avocados,
Is my theory from here out;
Crave guacamole

8 May 2012

Bottom of the bag
Bits and crumbs, sad, out of place
Chip effluvia

9 May 2012

With light just breaking
I stand before the morning
Ready for the day

10 May 2012

Last light banked below
Shadows as blankets draw closer
Ready for the night

11 May 2012

Glory eternal
Consider the falafel
The joy that it brings

12 May 2012

What was I thinking?
Late night cravings leading to
Dishes of Ghastly

13 May 2012

Late night boredom turns
Reveals, hidden, a mission:
Cross the Brooklyn Bridge

14 May 2012

A random day off
Productivity Promise,
Really Laziness

15 May 2012

From down the street comes
A tinny little tune, bright
Promise of ice cream

16 May 2012

``Congratulations'' ---
I say again and again ---
``Now sit the hell down.''

17 May 2012

Pitcher in the Sun
Full of cold iced tea, glistens
Noble refreshment

18 May 2012

Never staying still
Ill-fitting bed sheets: bonkers
Unfolded slumber

19 May 2012

Hidden is growing
Recycling under the sink
Nothing, then explodes

20 May 2012

A tiny insect
Wanders down from the river
To land on my hand

21 May 2012

Deep in the belly
Of the thing that will consume;
I forget to lunch

22 May 2012

If a clean desk is
A sign of insanity
I'm perfectly sane

23 May 2012

An endless circle
Running that takes all the time
And running, makes time

24 May 2012

Rocking and creaking
Bits falling off left and right
I still keep the chair

25 May 2012

A call late at night,
Holy Fuck I'm an Uncle
Meghan joins the world

26 May 2012

Late night, up running
Means a rough start next morning
Give me some coffee

27 May 2012

Brunch: standing in line
A long wait, going elsewhere
Tasty food follows

28 May 2012

The long path tonight
Simple joy, meandering
No hurry for home

29 May 2012

Softly the bird flits
Lands, bending a stalk of grass
Butterfly annoyed

30 May 2012

Soft dusty exhale
A warm breath growing colder
Air conditioner

31 May 2012

A constant nagging
Bit of thread, unraveling
Unknits sanity

1 June 2012

In a fusion kiln
Vast photons are exploded
Breaking the morning

2 June 2012

Sometimes I wonder
What the trees are whispering
Wood conspiracy

3 June 2012

Deadlock: Need coffee
No coffee, so go to store
Need coffee for that

4 June 2012

I the way to work
I wrote a perfect haiku
And then forgot it

5 June 2012

Wrapped in a blanket
Against cold it does not feel
An old computer

6 June 2012

Of elevators
I'm devising strategies
Lofty ambitions

7 June 2012

City's summer breeze
A stuffy subway station
The train, rushing in

8 June 2012

A shade canopy
In reducing the sun makes
A million of them

9 June 2012

Blank sheet of paper
Stunning, white; a thick black line
Exploding, brilliant

10 June 2012

I want some waffles
But have no iron to make
And this makes me sad

11 June 2012

I dream of syrup
Still craving waffles, I must
Get a pile soon

12 June 2012

Standing guard, a bug
Sitting on the window sill
Its friends are outside

13 June 2012

How does one wash a
Window five stories up?
It bugs even me

14 June 2012

A bus, kneeling down
Sighs as it offers people
A place to rest feet

15 June 2012

In falafel, life
Dear sweet delicious life, with
Tahini on top

16 June 2012

Barely visable
Spots in my camera lens
Driving me batty

17 June 2012

Breezy, or quiet?
Two ends of the fan spectrum
Science has failed us

18 June 2012

It's the worst tickle
The back of the throat alarms
Sinuses explode

19 June 2012

A false winding up
My tick-tock spring was going
Before unhinging

20 June 2012

Fierce intensity
With rays blinding in the sky
The Sun, overhead

21 June 2012

Comet Mulberry
Intersummer voyage hits
Planet Myhat

22 June 2012

Nice kitchen towels
Soon become bad at my place
No fault of their own

23 June 2012

Dish soap on my hands
Weirdly makes them feel dirty
That would seem broken

24 June 2012

A ream of paper
Contemplates dictionaries
Why is that word `ream'?

25 June 2012

Not having a car
Has cut down my NPR
Listening quota

26 June 2012

The breeze feels so good
But drying out my eyeballs
Is there no pleasure?

27 June 2012

All of a sudden
I realized that I'm not
Sweating like a duck

28 June 2012

It seems insolent
A rock, millions of years old
Kicked by a child

29 June 2012

A late night snack rears
An ugly head, gnawing deep
Grinding the stomach

30 June 2012

With shallow movements
A dance with the intestine
Keeping it happy

1 July 2012

O Dear Canada
Days like today make me wish
I was in your shores

2 July 2012

How urbane I feel
After a bit of walking
Out doing errands

3 July 2012

Boxes in boxes
Like a wormhole growing, I
Take down recycling

4 July 2012

Is that Higgs' Boson?
Is there a Field that gives all
Things with mass their mass?

5 July 2012

A bundle of joy
See my niece for the first time
Spoil her rotten

6 July 2012

Way too much ice cream
First time tempted to go here
I blame my brother

7 July 2012

Fake hot dog, new form
A spiral cut brings skeptics
But the results win

8 July 2012

A tiny airplane
Hurtling at Jamaica Bay
Misses  --- LGA

9 July 2012

Lazy post travel
Things to do piling up, yet
I just do not care

10 July 2012

In the afternoon
Sanity prevails, as clouds
Boil from my mind

11 July 2012

The sway of readers
Like weeds in the deep blue sea
No ocean but track

12 July 2012

The sound of morning
Syrup, going down the drain
Consciousness fades in

13 July 2012

Falafel on wheat
Lentil soup, hot tea, to stay
Falafel Friday

14 July 2012

Fortran on my mind
Mostly a sign of sickness
Little need for that

15 July 2012

There's one eyebrow hair
A mutant, growing longer
Always freaks me out

16 July 2012

Swaying in the breeze
A forest of ropes, stretching
Reaching to the sky

17 July 2012

No newspaper guy
There at the subway station
The day I want one

18 July 2012

The longest minutes
Lie between starting coffee
And when it is done

19 July 2012

Hum of a printer
Whirring and clicking as it
Spits out a new zine

20 July 2012

I want to make maps
Of all the paths in the park
Relaxing journeys

21 July 2012

Italian, whiskey
A walk for some potatoes
Make a good birthday

22 July 2012

Plans for a Sunday
Start with a pot of coffee
Without, all else fails

23 July 2012

I still have a scar
From helping a friend to move
Stupid TV stand

24 July 2012

Thinking of postage
Getting weird stamps to add up
Need to get out more

25 July 2012

In the summertime
Is there anything better
Than a cool iced tea?

26 July 2012

Walking through the rain
Taking photos; my mind sighs
Relaxing nature

27 July 2012

Crave peanut butter
And bananas, nutella
I need a sandwich

28 July 2012

Blankets blanketing
Holding me down in the bed
Is why I'm asleep

29 July 2012

Some variation
To get you out of the groove
Is necessary

30 July 2012

Walking past the park
People enjoying the shade
The end of the day

31 July 2012

More posters hung up
Not enough, at least a start
Need to get more string

1 August 2012

I need photo prints
A bunch of pictures to hang
De-barren my walls

2 August 2012

Sometimes I'm early
First one into the office
Dim, I make coffee

3 August 2012

Glides by gracefully
Seconds before I get there
Sub disappointment

4 August 2012

Why am I awake?
It's the weekend, stupid brain,
So go back to sleep

5 August 2012

Once you crave breakfast
There is no satisfaction
Until there's breakfast

6 August 2012

A walk clears the mind
A blank slate, traquil and calm
Now ideas can form

7 August 2012

Of all the socks lost
Not one of them is ever
A sock that I hate

8 August 2012

High into the air
Landing before we know it
A short airplane flight

9 August 2012

Dinner with a friend
After eating way too much
Walk to burn it off

10 August 2012

Delta's distant voice
There's no flight for me today
Rescue me, Amtrak

11 August 2012

Thoughts turning to kale
Strong, leafy vegetable
Full of nutrients

12 August 2012

Joy that clean sheets bring
Crisp and cool yet warm, inviting
Lull into slumber

13 August 2012

Cutting oneself, bad.
Cut when there is vinegar?
It's just that much worse

14 August 2012

On the way to work
Reading a book; words enter
Sticking to my mind

15 August 2012

Sticking yet not stuck
Hold with firmness, yields with touch
Masking tape. I'm bored.

16 August 2012

Cereal. Say it.
Soft and flowing, a whisper
Not crunchy, tinkle

17 August 2012

Tonight, I go out!
But movies here, and take out.
Lure into staying

18 August 2012

The past ten minutes
The band in the park has played
The same four phrases

19 August 2012

I need more gumption
Every weekend morning
Results in sleeping

20 August 2012

An amusing graph
Up on my cubicle wall
Always makes me laugh

21 August 2012

There is sometimes in
Work, relaxation; the mind
focused --- unburdened

22 August 2012

Brief cacophony
Sudden, and then it is gone
The neighborhood still

23 August 2012

Weird noises from pipes
Now how I want to wake up
Be calm there, shower

24 August 2012

Cutting board, wood grain
Grooves from a thousand cuts stack
Worn away by time

25 August 2012

Thinking of objects
And more objects of objects
Then my mind objects

26 August 2012

First, not enough tape
And then, after buying some
I find seven rolls

27 August 2012

The Hudson calms me
Placid waters drain my stress;
Breeze invigorates

28 August 2012

Students have returned
And they are all in my way
Grumpy old man mode

29 August 2012

Three balloons escape
Denied freedom for so long
Go stratospheric

30 August 2012

Thumper, not booting
Oracle tech replaces
Nearly everything

31 August 2012

Today I crave Fall:
Cooler weather, harvest foods
Hot cider, doughnuts

1 September 2012

Need a stasis field
For the food stuck in my fridge;
It goes bad too soon

2 September 2012

Some music, blasting
Comes through my open window
I hate all of you

3 September 2012

A quiet morning
Black coffee, quiet reading
Some haiku, and you

4 September 2012

A mental model
Of how some shelves should be built.
Now reality?

5 September 2012

With a tick, a leaf
Starts its breakdown, on the ground
Returning to it

6 September 2012

Even when cooking
The word `rub', vaguely dirty
Bothering my mind

7 September 2012

Not all things are neat
Some stories lack a moral
Some just lack a plot

8 September 2012

Nearly a year gone
And this door still annoys me.
Memo: sandpaper

9 September 2012

Rounding a corner
I see a dog with balloons
I need more coffee

10 September 2012

The rumble tumble
Is no place for weakened ones:
Nifty socks die first

11 September 2012

From an old party
A laurel wreath, on a shelf,
Shedding dry bay leaves

12 September 2012

With repetition
You slowly drag a new skill
To experienced

13 September 2012

Dinner in the park
A pleasant evening walk
This day ended well

14 September 2012

In case of fire
I swear I didn't do it
You'll never catch me!

15 September 2012

Vortex of noisy
Being shuffled back and forth
Makes the carpet clean

16 September 2012

On a wave of light
Color, streaming from the Sun
Warming the sidewalk

17 September 2012

You may talk the talk.
You may even walk the walk.
Do you sit the sit?

18 September 2012

Struggle with the seal
The pickle jar, suddenly
Opens, briney splash

19 September 2012

A boom from outside
Someone's car hit a light post
Flashy lights ensue

20 September 2012

An ancient well sits---
That's not true, it doesn't sit.
An ancient well deeps.

21 September 2012

Anniversary.
There should be a party for
That word's creation

22 September 2012

High voltage. Ozone.
The hum of transformers, low.
Weird infrastructure.

23 September 2012

That box a mistake
Stuff I shouldn't have but keep
Throw away? No, store.

24 September 2012

When I'm dictator,
There will be a penalty
For cell phones on stairs

25 September 2012

Why does grapefruit juice
Seem like it's tasty to me,
After years of hate?

26 September 2012

There's territory,
Not organization here.
Clouds of stuff, not shelves.

27 September 2012

A daily crossing
And an eternal question:
Will I beat the train?

28 September 2012

Going in reverse
I eat dessert first, because
Life is uncertain

29 September 2012

Unhappy damp towel
Works poorly to dry dishes
Get another one

30 September 2012

Ponder overhead
The trillions of molecules
Pounding on your skull


1 October 2012

Hospital corners
Are my bedding obsession
This is new to me

2 October 2012

I want a rocket
And a trip to outer space
Where's my transporter?

3 October 2012

A visit from Mom
Means a flury of cleaning
I hope it's enough

4 October 2012

After a long flight
Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop is
Where you go refuel

5 October 2012

If you seek cool winds
The Staten Island Ferry
Is where you should go

6 October 2012

If you visit me
One thing is undoubtable:
You will have a slice

7 October 2012

On a rainy day
In the financial district
Under umbrella

8 October 2012

The Air Train visits
All the Newark Terminals
Each one in sequence

9 October 2012

I thought ahead here
Taking the day off after
Having visitors

10 October 2012

At least a short week
Is all I have to endure.
Half way, already.

11 October 2012 

It is amazing
This lady, subway, makeup.
I would smudge it all

12 October 2012

The basket, shifting
Holding bread, or holding fruit
No allegiances

13 October 2012

Yes, please, stand right there.
The top of the stairs is great.
None of us need move.

14 October 2012

You hear of dreadnaughts
Giant ships from days of yore ---
But not dreadsomethings.

15 October 2012

By dint of dinting
Something totally somethings
There is the result

16 October 2012

In this apartment
There are many envelopes
I never find them

17 October 2012

For a sick stomach
Milkshake of Magnesia
Worst doctor ever

18 October 2012

Some rapid typing
Paused for prolonged head scratching
Figuring things out

19 October 2012

Aside from waking
Today isn't a bad day.
I just want more sleep.

20 October 2012

Everything still ---
A small breeze kisses the leaves
Who now love the ground

21 October 2012

A Roundabout Way
Is where I will live when I
Win the lottery.

22 October 2012

A small symmetry
Becoming a pattern, broke
One corner disturbed

23 October 2012

Cozy is the chair
With a hot drink, a good book
And an empty night

24 October 2012

A lamp, shining bright
Makes it so that I can see
But glares the TV

25 October 2012

What harm is there in
A second doughnut today?
Tight pants tomorrow.

26 October 2012

I curse all coughing
And noses that don't function
Stupid infections

27 October 2012

Apparently there's
A giant ass storm coming
I sleep off sickness

28 October 2012

With a giant storm
Nothing to do but wait and
Curse my stupid cold

29 October 2012

Lights over the park
Must mean a transformer's gone
Up in New Jersey

30 October 2012

Hey, fuck you Sandy
Can't keep the coffee shop down
Espresso and scoff

31 October 2012

Stopping and starting
Too tight to jostle around
The long bus to work

1 November 2012

There's another bus
Where it stops is uncertain ---
Certain frustration

2 November 2012

A hell of a week
The city feels strained but tough
A different vibe

3 November 2012

The cold isn't bad
The constant sleepyness, though
Naps no longer fun

4 November 2012

Up here, some flooding
As the 207th Yard
Floods the 8th Ave Line

5 November 2012

After work, cleaning
Laundry, the dishes, tidy
Make the place look neat

6 November 2012

A new visitor
A quick blur, lightning shadow
It's a stupid mouse

7 November 2012

A helicopter
Shimmers in the sky, then leaves
Its blades an echo

8 November 2012

Video backlog
Handled with insomnia
I don't need to sleep

9 November 2012

Another weird word:
Towel: soft end expected
But hard `t' throws off

10 November 2012

Neither and nor but
Not only yet but also
Whether for or so

11 November 2012

The Parks Department
Grinding away at broken trees
Disturbing my nap

12 November 2012

Sometimes I'm solo
In a vast crowd of people
There, but separate

13 November 2012

Climb with confidence
Don't dawdle on the staircase
Be bold and don't hold

14 November 2012

Salt of the Earth: good
Yet salting the earth is bad.
Who made this shit up?

15 November 2012

Cunning nonchalance
As I watch my dear mouse friend
Steal food from the trap

16 November 2012

It's the worst warning
Itching when you have to sneeze
Just in time: cover

17 November 2012

Walking past often
For the first time I go in
What a lovely place

18 November 2012

A half lyric, stuck
Sing along until I can't
Then hum the next part

19 November 2012

A hall, dark, glitters
Lights glow as hundreds chit-chat
On a cold night, warmth

20 November 2012 

Walkways at airports
Are like real life speed boosters
Video game like

21 November 2012

The Bx7
The final stop: Isham Street
Hate when it ends there

22 November 2012

Lord of the Rings Day
Too much food, too much movies
Not enough napping

23 November 2012

Productive today?
Why would I ever think that?
I am a moron.

24 November 2012

Brief recognition
A face that I think I know.
It's not, I walk on

25 November 2012

I walk for leisure
The best way I can relax
Just step after step

26 November 2012

Gravity sure sucks
It's just keeping me down man
The Earth pulling me

27 November 2012

A vast twisty maze
Configuration jumbled
I just hate Java

28 November 2012

A railing of brass
Worn down by many decades
A million hands touch

29 November 2012

With a bang it falls
A stack of books left too long
Sliding to the floor

30 November 2012

Length of a mile
Warping here in the city
Long and short of it

1 December 2012

Boring afternoon
Changed by a friend's appendix
Out with it we go

2 December 2012

In a hospital
Helping out a friend, we watch
Charlie Brown Christmas

3 December 2012

There is joy in soup
Sometimes there is a sandwich
Sometimes there is not

4 December 2012

Copying song, doot.
Copy faster, file please
Doot doot doot doot doo

5 December 2012

Sometimes, not awake
Shower aimed right at my face
When I turn it on

6 December 2012

With experience
I become more a novice
Knowing what to know

7 December 2012

Right material
Suffers from the wrong idea
Dinner has gone bad

8 December 2012

Turntable, dusty
On a reciever, unused
I clean each weekend

9 December 2012

To watch a movie
I have to stop picking which
I should watch

10 December 2012

New Jersey hidden
As a wall of fog sails down
The Hudson River

11 December 2012

Sci-fi flashing lights
Brighten the street; prozaic
A pawn broker sign

12 December 2012

Happy when words flow
Writing makes seratonin
And done, joyfulness

13 December 2012

At work we have some
Fancy holiday parties
It's good to work here

14 December 2012

In my bathroom some
Plaster stalactites hang down
Ancient mystery

15 December 2012

Breakfast, beautiful
Thoughts of warm fuzzy eating
There is coffee too

16 December 2012

A buzz at the door
I don't care what you're selling
I don't want any

17 December 2012

Some things need repair
But sit in closets for years
Away with you now

18 December 2012

Mystery package
Owner tracked down, lives nearby
Meet at the subway

19 December 2012

Revert some changes
Wonder what I was thinking
Have some more coffee

20 December 2012

Without quarters my
Coin jar fills up more slowly
But still it gets full

21 December 2012

A whole block of cheese
Ended up in my stomach
Do not ask me how

22 December 2012

Random spaghetti
Dinner made the last minute
Turns out pretty well

23 December 2012

On the wall there is
A lone strand of spaghetti
Where did that come from?

24 December 2012

Pine branches, some lights
A cold window, a warm home
Hot cocoa, life's good

25 December 2012

Wandering Brooklyn
Later we get Chinese food
A good Christmas day

26 December 2012

On a campus still
Snow hushes the city, sound
Replaced with silence

27 December 2012

After work, dinner
Don't know what we should get so
Pick a random place

28 December 2012

I blink, but it stays
Grit in my eyes, up too late
But this book is good

29 December 2012

Across the river
Brooklyn calls out good music
A concert tonight

30 December 2012

For a second night
I see They Might Be Giants
One more night to go

31 December 2012

Rock in the New Year
They Might Be Giants concert
I love living here

1 January 2013

By the East River
The city reminds me just
How lucky I am

2 January 2013

What's that sensation?
Upcoming feeling of doom ---
Just my alarm clock

3 January 2013

Similarity
Two containers look the same
The one I grab wrong

4 January 2013

Sometimes things don't work
Key is to take the pieces
And make something else

5 January 2013

Time for a movie.
Which one do I want to see?
Then hours pass by.

6 January 2013

Don't know direction
Know the feel of the city
My feet get me there

7 January 2013

In my conviction
This thing works a certain way
In reality...

8 January 2013

The must on the grapes
A must when you're making wine?
Or must you remove?

9 January 2013

A simple mixture
Each brings a contribution
Yummy food forthwith

10 January 2013

First night Trevoring
Answering Trevor letters
After, there are chips

11 January 2013

Beacons around me
Where there is pizza, there's hope
I buy some slices

12 January 2013

What is this acid
Never heard of it before
Sitting in my food

13 January 2013

Hanging from the wall
A lone spider thread --- not web
Dusting takes care of

14 January 2013

Too much junk in here
Some things are destined for scrap
Or a flamethrower

15 January 2013

Evening of Awesome
People who are amazing
Fill Carnegie Hall

16 January 2013

An alternate dish
When the main ingredient
Isn't at the store

17 January 2013

Nerding out over
Marshall Kirk McKusick's talk
BSD book signed

18 January 2013

An act in three parts
Concerto for bubbling pipes
Bubble, squeak and hiss

19 January 2013

Read about the brain
Making my brain think of brains
A headache ensues

20 January 2013

We start with a plan
And minutes in that goes out
Winging it from here

21 January 2013

Tamale making
Is a very refined craft
I need more practice

22 January 2013

An idea flashes
Last minute horchata made
Why'd I wait so long?

23 January 2013

Feeling off today
But a walk as always helps
It's cheap therapy

24 January 2013

Every minute last
Something always must be done
The list keeps going

25 January 2013

The plane lands, a bump:
Iowa! Pigs and corn reign!
All sits before me

26 January 2013

Pardon me today
I have a niece to spoil
No one else matters

27 January 2013

A sink of dishes
An hour of happy swish
House meditation

28 January 2013

Knives flashing, food flies
A hot griddle a palate
An artist cooking

29 January 2013

The wind swiftly moves
Scouring the ground, freshly
Now covered in snow

30 January 2013

Leaving the bubble
Going out for some shopping
Good to be back home

31 January 2013

The closet, my coat
The handle broken, I'm stuck
Not going outside

1 February 2013

Closet victory!
Doorknob broken, defeated
A door now opens

2 February 2013

Sweet vermouth, rocks, twist
Phil comes out day after day
Watch that first step --- bing!

3 February 2013

On the door a badge
Shows the apartment number
This is what's within

4 February 2013

A beacon shines bright
Yelling 'Doughnuts' in the night
Welcome sign in dark times

5 February 2013

Not all can be whole
Sometimes you need broken glass
To make a mural

6 February 2013

There is a limit
To how much I can handle
Then I need a nap

7 February 2013

A dusty cupboard
With cans you'll never open ---
Just go to the store

8 February 2013

Closing door, stand clear
Your back pack is delaying
Just get it inside

9 February 2013

Wake up with grumpy
Walk to the corner, coffee
The world is good now

10 February 2013

A theater dark
Blinds us with jazz from the stage
Weighty history

11 February 2013

Not to big or small
A medium medium
Gets the spirits right

12 February 2013

In situating
You must get just the right snug
Too much is too bad

13 February 2013

Infinite rainbow
A spectrum mostly unseen
But very useful

14 February 2013

To the Post Office
There is mailing to be done
Stamps to be purchased

15 February 2013

Sometimes adventure
Just means tomato soup and
Grilled cheese sandwiches

16 February 2013

Following the bus
See that it's the one I need;
Wait for the next one

17 February 2013

A cooking mix-up
Is a chance to improvise
Which turned out ok

18 February 2013

A sword hanging high
Arboreal, a branch swings
Creaking in the breeze

19 February 2013

Two ships, forever
Stuck in a sea of velvet
Sail my living room

20 February 2013

Temptation abounds:
A packing tape dispenser ---
Taping ALL the things!

21 February 2013

Grabbing a sandwich
A lack of chips counfounding
Almonds it is, then

22 February 2013

Find the replacement
For an irreplaceable
Leads to frustration

23 February 2013

The horizon shrinks
Distances once short, lengthen
Here in the city

24 February 2013

A simple labor
Folding all of the laundry
Confounded by naps

25 February 2013

A dozen is twelve
Randomly, I wonder why
Latin is to blame

26 February 2013

Boil long enough
And you make a nice syrup;
To long, it's carbon

27 February 2013

In the neighborhood
Mr. Rogers may be gone
But his deeds live on

28 February 2013

In squeezing olives
There's a wonderful oil;
It's good on salads

1 March 2013

Shortest to longest
The dreary March rain drips on
Will Spring ever come?

2 March 2013

Tiny, dark and deep
An inglorious end waits
Down the garbage chute

3 March 2013

When will this fad end?
Adults, parading around
On two wheeled scooters

4 March 2013

While doing dishes
I'm thinking about bubbles
As my mind turns off

5 March 2013

Lift up your troubles
Showing them the light of day
Sunshine's the best cure

6 March 2013

If you wear Google
Glasses when you're at the bar
You are a douchebag

7 March 2013

Errant eyebrow hair
Why are you freakishly long
Keep pulling you out

8 March 2013

A paper graveyard
The bottom of my pocket
Numerous recipts

9 March 2013

Dusk coming later
The days are feeling warmer
Spring is creeping in

10 March 2013

Ladder in the sky
Hanging from a hook; you drop
When stuff's on fire

11 March 2013

There's a remedy
It involves taking a nap
Universal cure

12 March 2013

Too much, horrible
Not enough, bland and tasteless
Add just enough salt

13 March 2013

High upon a ridge
A tall tower sits, blinking
Keep airplanes away

14 March 2013

Bring forth onto me
A vast glorious breakfast
Need cholesterol

15 March 2013

Waiting for the queue
Backed-up jobs not processing
Go forward, minions

16 March 2013

With a faint puff, dark
The lightbulb gives up the ghost
Leaves just a dark spot

17 March 2013

The lack of coffee
Manifests itself: headache
Dull pain of a day

18 March 2013

Dreaming of nuggets
Peanuts and chocolate dance
There is caramel

19 March 2013

Underneith the bed
The dust of a thousand days
Skitters in the breeze

20 March 2013

Do I fear scurvy?
A sudden craving: grapefruit
Eating three of them

21 March 2013

Tarrytown at night
The wind blowing, train horn sounds
Metro North back home

22 March 2013

A quiet corner
An 80s bachelor pad
Rocks sitting, dusty

23 March 2013

I am an old man
Concerts starting at midnight
Don't work well for me

24 March 2013

A song, in a loop
Stuck firm in a fuzzy head
Is how I woke up

25 March 2013

Say bobbin, bobbin
The word, petulant, explodes
A curious bit

26 March 2013

Dirty rock and roll
Cider in hand, a dim room
Makes for a good night

27 March 2013

Cruft accumulates
Duct tape layers on layers
Time to rip it off

28 March 2013

On a ball in space
Floating along the cosmos
People fill the street

29 March 2013

Luminous sasquatch
Lead taco press on a shelf
Jibber jabber hey

30 March 2013

The late afternoon
Streams through the window, blinds
Why work? Take a walk.

31 March 2013

Simple is sometimes
The best way to do something
Don't get fancy now

1 April 2013

Stupid --- stupider:
Lame April Fools jokes anguish.
Put thought into it

2 April 2013

Tour the dark side
Discover that they have cake
To hell with goodness

3 April 2013

Foam lapping the shore
A gurgling river flows by
Cares washing away

4 April 2013

Don't want a monkey
Unless it's a smart monkey
One that will wear pants

5 April 2013

In a man's life, there 
Comes a time for seersucker
For this man, today

6 April 2013

A saucer, a cup
Hot water becoming tea
Morning in Inwood

7 April 2013

In the cracks of cheese
Tasty mold making it bleu
A dressing awaits

8 April 2013

A bird in flight turns
Into the sun, and too close
Finds infinity

9 April 2013

Filing files
F for file, R for rasp
This work grinds away

10 April 2013

AE-35
Sending a lonely signal
A whisper, a fault

11 April 2013

Constant consonant
The base of words, not flashy
Not sharp like vowels

12 April 2013

A cherry purches
Proud like a queen on a cloud
An ice cream soda

13 April 2013

A doctrine I have:
An elephant on a crane
Is not stood under

14 April 2013

Morning energy
Quickly turns to lazyness
Do things tomorrow

15 April 2013

A roll of string falls
Grasping at it makes it worse
I grab, it races

16 April 2013

A tiny gate on
A tiny patch of front lawn
A tiny dog sits

17 April 2013

What a shame it is
To be a fire fighter
Fire trucks boring

18 April 2013

``They're the wrong trousers,''
he said, with his hands shaking,
``And they have gone wrong!''

19 April 2013

Old British guys in
Academic dress, nerding
Out all day today

20 April 2013

A good thing better:
A cute guy riding the bus
Reading {\em Good Omens}

21 April 2013

Apartment contrasts:
Some things done very cheaply
Some places marble

22 April 2013

Pocket watch unwatch
The shell exists but no time
No time right or wrong

23 April 2013

Retire early
Too much Chinese food, and zines
Then I fall to sleep

24 April 2013

Flywheels spinning up
A low hum becomes a whine
Ready to burst forth

25 April 2013

Ephemeral song
By an orchestra not there
Makes me march in time

26 April 2013

The day done, gladness
That all of the days are done
At least for two days

27 April 2013

First there are pickles
Biscuits and vegan gravy
Too much food to eat

28 April 2013

Clouds stretch for miles
Bursting with light, the sun sets
The clouds float away

29 April 2013

Must learn the organ
Want to play Animals songs
Intentions are good

30 April 2013

Tape not sticking well
Package keeps unraveling
Break out the good stuff

1 May 2013

Oh fuck you, April
I am so glad you are gone
I hated that month

2 May 2013

The sun, streaming in,
Makes a nice summer tableaux,
My screen, hard to see

3 May 2013

Getting tape started
Is the most difficult thing;
Crooked and tearing

4 May 2013

Each time I open
The closet this scarf falls down.
It's not winter, toss.

5 May 2013

Hit up the deli?
But I'd have to put on pants.
The world is so cruel

6 May 2013

A fork in the path
Which way you figure will be
The wrong way to take

7 May 2013

The dusty chasm
Below the radiator
Is a heartless place

8 May 2013

Area carpet
How did you get so dirty?
How do I clean you?

9 May 2013

Ikea sofa
Not as nice as a real one
But it's much cheaper

10 May 2013

In the late Spring breeze
Pulpy birds flutter along
Papers escaping

11 May 2013

The Fresh Squeezed Juice Guy
Serves happiness from a cart
Admire his work

12 May 2013

Wash down the river
O cares of the hectic day
Let the water calm

13 May 2013

It's getting warm, but
I want some garlic cheese bread
Turn on the oven

14 May 2013

I'm at an auction,
Selling frat guys, takes credit
This is dangerous

15 May 2013

Thank you, little cloud
For taking the sun away
And letting me see

16 May 2013

Come in my spaceship
As we chart the starry sky
And dance with the moons

17 May 2013

Time for new glasses
The old ones stuck together
With glue and hoping

18 May 2013

New Star Trek Movie
The plot is horribly weak
The popcorn was good

19 May 2013

The laundry is done
The dishes are now drying
Time to take a nap

20 May 2013

Posters are classy
When framed and hung with some care
These posters are not

21 May 2013

Buying my niece toys
Makes me jealous of my niece
And all her cool toys

22 May 2013

Academy fields
People in robes mingling
Just sit down, okay?

23 May 2013

Hours in Detroit
Would be fine if I wasn't
Stuck in the airport

24 May 2013

Iowa. Corn fields.
Gravel roads wet from the rain.
Nothing for miles.

25 May 2013

Her first time with cake
My niece absolutely kills
We have trained her well

26 May 2013

You could have ice cream
You could have some more ice cream
Also, there's ice cream

27 May 2013

Late at night, Newark
Passing by the train window
Waiting to get home

28 May 2013

People who whistle
Mindlessly in the subway
Up against the wall

29 May 2013

Last of the H train
I go the Rockaways
To give it a ride

30 May 2013

Look there, tall building
Angles all of the way up
Hiding in round clouds

31 May 2013

The name of the song
Escaping your mind; lyrics
A jumbled mash-up

1 June 2013

Day-off grogginess
Sloth becoming a headache
Too much sleep can hurt

2 June 2013

Sitting on the train
A book on a tiny screen
I love the future

3 June 2013

Where am I? What's this?
The brain all fuzzy barely
Remembers the pants

4 June 2013

A ream of paper
Blank slates, five-hundred ideas
Waiting to be filled

5 June 2013

The wire, curled
A resounding thud, just right
Pages together

6 June 2013

A bend and a crease
Pages becoming booklets
Simple is complex

7 June 2013

Powdered plastic bits
With intense heat dots take form
Words appear from dust

8 June 2013

Hottest cop ever
I want to get arrested
Throw the cuffs on me

9 June 2013

Dreaming of cheesecake
But savory, with salsa
Sick but alluring

10 June 2013

The day unfolding
A list of things to get done
Checkmarks are success

11 June 2013

Fluent in nonsense
The mutterer ambles by
Not sure what he wants

12 June 2013

Dude on the subway
Your dancing is very good
Early morning joy, not

13 June 2013

Down the the Village
A late night pizza craving
Joe's of Bleeker Street

14 June 2013

\[ Lost Haiku \]

15 June 2013

A digital stroke
Years of bits in the darkness
Go! To the backups!

16 June 2013

Rebuilding things sucks
There is a silver lining
Lucky with timing

17 June 2013

A digital stroke
Symptoms include sleeplessness
Some anxiety

18 June 2013

A sigh of relief
As my home directory
Comes back in one piece

19 June 2013

Hearing a whisper
I look at my computer
The volume turned down

20 June 2013

Capitalism!
It's cradle I roam freely
Later there's a bell

21 June 2013

A timeless debate
And a common sense answer
Rarely workable

22 June 2013

Just one more chapter
Was my call to sleepytime ---
Three chapters ago

23 June 2013

A sprinkling of dust
A faint taint on the bookshelf
Annoying to clean

24 June 2013

Thinking of slicing
The optimum tofu slice
Divide evenly

25 June 2013

The craving of crunch
But not from chips, or crackers,
An apple, maybe?

26 June 2013

Pretty blue flower
Waving in the wind, happy
Doesn't have to work

27 June 2013

A drunken moth swerves
Slamming into the light bulb
Evolution screwed

28 June 2013

Forty-four years past
No longer do we stand by
Tonight, we fight back

29 June 2013

No gumption today
Become a sloth, stay in bed
No accomplishments

30 June 2013

In the Sun, waiting
Following a line down Fifth
Marching with Trevor


July 2013 Cover
A bit of folding
Careful layout, handwriting
I hope you enjoy

1 July 2013

For Canada Day
Fresh poutine, Strange Brew playing
Stand on guard for thee

2 July 2013

Data transfering
Bits of pictures uploading
Things frozen in time

3 July 2013

Hardware delivered
Dinner consumed, beer now gone
I got paid for this

4 July 2013

We stare down the street
Fireworks in the distance
For a bit, life stops

5 July 2013

Up late, not too late
Got some work done, now a nap
I think I've earned it

6 July 2013

Ball of string falling
Not lost, I know where it went
But I don't like it

7 July 2013

A day of culture
An abstract Russian I like
Art discovery

8 July 2013

The goal of tickets
Get them down under forty ---
Up to fifty-five

9 July 2013

Machine precision
Lines ruling regularly
Tree guts line the back

10 July 2013

Do not seek the Sun
It will find you, do not fear
Sunscreen will not help

11 July 2013

In it is a book
Grocery lists, pocket stains
Uncap it and write

12 July 2013

Friday night gumption
Has me cooking up a storm
Eating mellows me

13 July 2013

Turn on all the taps
The water flowing slowly
Will trickle on down

14 July 2013

A hot night, pommes frites
Ugly building exhales cold
On the street I eat

15 July 2013

Just one thing to do:
Watch old British sitcoms and
Order in pizza

16 July 2013

Turning song lyrics
Into a haiku --- lazy
I won't do it here

17 July 2013

Okay, in the past
I made song lyrics haiku
We all make mistakes

18 July 2013

How did I anger?
The train gods ruin some plans,
With the worst timing

19 July 2013

Some folks bemoan; but
Thirty-five isn't for wimps
I'm not backing down

20 July 2013

A Saturday night
With good friends, good food, whiskey
What more do you need?

21 July 2013

The joy of pickles
Sharp, sweet, sour, salty, good
Just like life itself

22 July 2013

When life hands you rain
You duck inside for a slice
Pizza restores hope

23 July 2013

Humidity hangs
With a crack, the sky opens
The hangs becomes rains

24 July 2013

The Sun angers me
Aluminum foil fix
Try to get through that!

25 July 2013

Back to work today
Reading e-mail I wonder:
What do I do here?

26 July 2013

A machine, six years
My digital life returns
Third time I've seen it

27 July 2013

You win, MTA
In Poetry in Motion
There is happiness

28 July 2013

Eighty-years standing
What has this apartment seen?
Do you want to know?

29 July 2013

A grainy photo
Slices history, dragging
The past into now

30 July 2013

Noble Juice Cart Guy
Slice squeeze stir pour happiness
You are my hero

31 July 2013

Oh ConEdison
You show me two different
Amounts that I owe

1 August 2013

With a grinding POP!
The blender gives up the ghost
To a better place

2 August 2013

Your sheets are cotton
Simple, white, and with no fuss
Anything else pales

3 August 2013

A subway ride away
An awesome band is playing
There on the platform

4 August 2013

A bumbling robot
May be more useful than this
Crappy help system

5 August 2013

Hunger the best sauce
Or at least hallucogen
PB-Cheerios

6 August 2013

Flags change direction
The scent of the air, subtle
Becomes sea salty

7 August 2013

A friend off for years
A whole evening of dinner
And of catching up

8 August 2013

A combat gymnast
Second Pommel Horse Brigade
Jumps in formation

9 August 2013

Aquatic pounding
The river, running high, spills
The drains do not hold

10 August 2013

A beautiful night
Gorgeous park, favorite band
I love living here

11 August 2013

A pile of kale
Sauted, sesame oil
Food for the whole week

12 August 2013

Distant cargo floats
Grabbed by the sky, it settles
One more ride then home

13 August 2013

On a pedestal
You have greater potential
Do not squander it

14 August 2013

A hungry city
Somehow swallowed up my phone
Glad for insurance

15 August 2013

Waiting for a phone
As the clock ticks, time slows down
Call me when its here

16 August 2013

An evening, empty
Countless possibilities
Should I stay or go?

17 August 2013

Monochromatic
The first light of dawn breaking
Pale hint of the day

18 August 2013

Data injustice
File strewn about the place
Clean out the homedir

19 August 2013

The front of the train
Flying off into the sky
Dawn, the aqueduct

20 August 2013

In a pinch, fake it
You'll probably get away
There's nothing to lose

21 August 2013

Victory, defeat
Sometimes things are both of them
Life is not simple

22 August 2013

Fair distribution
A bit here, and a bit there
Good, but not much fun

23 August 2013

A low triangle
Watches the traffic go by
Sitting, biding time

24 August 2013

Fire a privilege
Use its power carefully
Or you will get burned

25 August 2013

A solid dresser
Does not move that easily
Short pain for long life

26 August 2013

It is not painless
But a complete scrubbing gives
Joy beyond belief 

27 August 2013

A siren, drawling
Lazily asks, move aside
Slacker firetruck

28 August 2013

Getting in my way
Swarms of students move slowly
Blocking the sidewalk

29 August 2013

Shower to get clean?
Or a bit of a reprieve,
From the day ahead?

30 August 2013

In a raven's claw
The head of the poet Poe.
``You say nevermore!"

31 August 2013

Doctor Octopus
Operates two at a time
Tentacles to spare

1 September 2013

On Skype with my niece.
I pretend to be trapped in
The television

2 September 2013

An expressive mood
An early Monday morning
Want more fucking sleep

3 September 2013

It's blended hollow
A mish-mash does not add up
Straight-up whiskey please

4 September 2013

Faith in obsession?
Or an obsession with faith?
Where was I going?

5 September 2013

A gift of chalk brings
Brightness to the sidewalk dull
With the city's dust

6 September 2013

Waking up early
I hatch a feeling, it grows
Make it a good day

7 September 2013

Dangling from a chain
High in the New Jersey sky
What was I thinking?

8 September 2013

Becoming hotter
A dull glow, faint, surfaces
Time to make French fries

9 September 2013

Natural belief
Supernatural reason
One wins in the end

10 September 2013

In-situ hacking
No line input, sound system
Old school hold the mic

11 September 2013

A simple doodle
With iteration becomes
Queer infinity

12 September 2013

Dreams of carrot cake
Pretending that it's healthy
Doc is not amused

13 September 2013

In soup, there is truth
Sometimes the truth is hidden
Don't let it fool you

14 September 2013

What a thing it is
A brisk autumn morn, coffee
A walk through the park

15 September 2013

Your tag means nothing
If you want to impress me
Make art that's breathless

16 September 2013

My ancestral brain
Speaks of cabbage and butter
And some potatoes

17 September 2013

Bust a gut laughing
A hurt all from happiness
Gasping for breath now

18 September 2013

Nobody told me
A cute guy in my building
Where's the damn memo?

19 September 2013

A fearless boardroom
Is just a room, a table
And a PR spin

20 September 2013

Fanatical pig
Swallowing all the quarters
Fat on pocket change

21 September 2013

Focus: nerding out
Staring at code until it
Finally makes sense

22 September 2013

Fair debauchery
Filling the bus with laughter
Wait for the revenge

23 September 2013

Grow insanity
Let it lie dormant, waiting 
For the seeds to sprout

24 September 2013

Fuzzy bit of light
Cannot focus, in a blur
Is it a migraine?

25 September 2013

Pot of soup cooking
Smelling good when I get home
It's the best feeling

26 September 2013

Among the monkeys
There's no higher honor than
Going bananas

27 September 2013

Days without fire
May keep me in employment
But are just boring

28 September 2013

Powerless cement
Freshly poured, now autographed
Growing hard with time

29 September 2013

Off in the distance
Appearing before my eyes
The Sun, it's morning

30 September 2013

Mountains from molehills;
Sometimes an amazing climb
Starts from something small
