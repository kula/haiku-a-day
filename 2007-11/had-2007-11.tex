After thinking about it for a couple years, and working on
and off on it since I moved to Ypsilanti, issue 0 of \emph{
Late Night Thinking} is done. 34 pages of ruminations about
moving to Michigan, tales of going to Toronto, and more about
making tea than you probably wanted to know. It's more perzine
that I'd like, but I've already got ideas for more interesting
stuff in the next issue. If you would like a copy, let me know.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

A pile of leaves \\
Crunches as I leave the bus \\
Becomming as dust

2 November 2007

Frost blankets the ground \\
As Ypsilanti awakes \\
Leaving a cold bed

Give me crackers, some cheese, \\
And a bit of fruit to eat \\
Simple meal delight

Urbana - Champaign \\
At UIUC I am \\
Talking TSM

5 November 2007

Walking for miles \\
I explore a new city \\
And seek what it hides

6 November 2007

When no one watches \\
I quickly dance a polka \\
Smiling to myself

7 November 2007

Why do you hate me \\
my stomach? You gurgle and \\
Fill me with much dread

8 November 2007

Tiny flakes of snow \\
They are but few, yet signal \\
The millions to come

9 November 2007

Cold is conforting \\
It wakes me, cuts to my core \\
Makes me feel alive

10 November 2007

Do you see the light? \\
I do, and am putting the \\
Band back together

Note to all my socks: \\
Where in the world did you go? \\
Please come back to me.

Beautiful Devine \\
How could I have lived this long \\
Without seeing you?

Morning, my hatred \\
Burns for you as a red sun \\
Destroying all life

They Might Be Giants \\
Fill Michigan Theater \\
With music and joy

15 November 2007

First the sun, now sleet \\
Clear to cloudy the sky grows \\
In the evening, snow

16 November 2007

Yellowed newspaper \\
Falling out of an old book \\
Brings back memories

I awake to dogs \\
Disturbing my deep slumber \\
Poisoning my dreams

18 November 2007

I'm riding alone \\
With the Huron as my guide \\
Moon smiling above

19 November 2007

Whipple is no more \\
The last rolls are unguarded \\
Who will chide squeezers?

20 November 2007

To Radulovich \\
You stood where others withered \\
Strong in your beliefs

21 November 2007

Going all over \\
I can't find that which I want \\
It is annoying

On the day I should \\
I did not take any naps \\
Must need tryptophane

My fingers freezing \\
Gloves that are just half fingers \\
Not good for winter

24 November 2007

The bookcase empty \\
Standing, waiting, such promise \\
To fill is a joy

25 November 2007

From the sky on high \\
Flakes of water, falling soft \\
Coat the ground with white

26 November 2007

Carmelized onion \\ 
A hidden treasure layer \\
I love my crock pot

27 November 2007

Twinkle twinkle start \\
High upon the far tower \\
Shine down upon us

Windows rimed with frost \\
Open to another world  \\
Dancing with snowflakes

A child sliding \\
Playing on an ice puddle \\
Brings back memories

I shall lose disks now \\
I won't go quietly, says \\
