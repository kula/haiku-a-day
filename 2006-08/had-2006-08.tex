Well, I've spent more time this month in hospitals
than I care two. First, I made tea at work and 
decided to rub my eye while a small grain of 
assam was still on my finger, which decided to stay
in for several hours until I went to the hospital
to have it removed.

Then my father decided to have his third heart
attack (fortunately while at St. Luke's hospital
in Cedar Rapids for a class) and was sent to the
Mayo Clinic, where he recovered down the hall 
from President Ford. Fortunately, my father is
doing much better now.

So, enough hospitals. They're like lawyers: you're
glad to have them when you need them, but otherwise
you'd rather not have to deal with them.
