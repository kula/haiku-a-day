It's currently raining outside, and there are clouds going in 
completely opposite directions. I love spring weather.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 April 2010

How I hate this day \\
The world, even more stupid \\
Annoying me more

2 April 2010

The world, split in two \\
Below, complicated, dense \\
Above, clear blue sky

\newpage

3 April 2010

In the stars, pictures \\
Mundane minds, fantastic worlds \\
Dots and lines shine through

4 April 2010

A smell embedded \\
Where I keep my coffee beans \\
Makes my nose happy

5 April 2010

I hail the sky, blue \\
Above me on this Monday \\
As I head to work

6 April 2010

Goodbye to sweaters! \\
I enjoy your company, \\
But we need a break

7 April 2010

Banner, flying high \\
Whipping in the wind, it falls \\
Pile on the ground

8 April 2010

Clear orbular parts \\
Growing smudged for no reason \\
Why do they do this?

9 April 2010

Pizza rolls, devine \\
A packet of pure happy \\
Simple and sublime

\newpage

10 April 2010

Hidden space opens \\
Behind the dash, voids and dust \\
Debris from ago

11 April 2010

Cool, yet the Sun shines \\
Forshadowing burns ahead \\
When it's not so nice

12 April 2010

Staring at the Sun \\
Making typing difficult \\
This window needs shade

13 April 2010

Pizza rolls, devine \\
A packet of pure happy \\
Simple and sublime

14 April 2010

Thoughts of libraries \\
Fill my head with happiness \\
Books overwhelm me

15 April 2010

Somewhere, a damn bird \\
Making a nest, making noise \\
Driving me crazy

16 April 2010

The week, ran ragged \\
Shudders to a halt, Friday \\
And life is easy

\newpage

17 April 2010

When old books I see \\
I feel a need to help them \\
Just dollars a day

18 April 2010

I see the sun shine \\ 
And find myself drawn outside \\
Basking in the light

19 April 2010

Goofy wireless \\
Connections break frequently \\
The network, annoyed

20 April 2010

The whisper of wind \\
Through the window, lullaby \\
Easing me to sleep

21 April 2010

Red fabric beckons \\
To finish a costume lost \\
To interruption

22 April 2010

So that's how it works \\
That doesn't make any sense \\
Feh, this thing is dumb

23 April 2010

A good day at work \\
Followed by a fun evening \\
Recipe for joy

\newpage

24 April 2010

Cleaning the kitchen \\
Before making the next mess \\
Need to fix timing

25 April 2010

Sundays are sleep days \\
Lounging in bed all day long \\
Why would I get up?

26 April 2010

Dreary rain outside \\
Yet early morning coffee \\
Makes it all better

27 April 2010

A faint smell returns \\
My mind to earlier times \\
Time travel by nose

28 April 2010

Something I do but \\
A few times a year, falling \\
Missing from my head

29 April 2010

How exactly does \\
One lose a sewing machine? \\
Oh where did it go?

30 April 2010

I am reminded \\
Of things I have to get done \\
Copious time gone
