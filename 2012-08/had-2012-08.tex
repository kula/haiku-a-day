Fall is here, and I, for one, am very glad for it. Windows open,
nights cool, the tastes of fall harvest appearing in the market.
Days shorter, the year winding down, and I am very happy.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

\vfill

1 August 2012

I need photo prints \\
A bunch of pictures to hang \\
De-barren my walls

2 August 2012

Sometimes I'm early \\
First one into the office \\
Dim, I make coffee

3 August 2012

Glides by gracefully \\
Seconds before I get there \\
Sub disappointment


\newpage

4 August 2012

Why am I awake? \\
It's the weekend, stupid brain, \\
So go back to sleep

5 August 2012

Once you crave breakfast \\
There is no satisfaction \\
Until there's breakfast

6 August 2012

A walk clears the mind \\
A blank slate, traquil and calm \\
Now ideas can form

7 August 2012

Of all the socks lost \\
Not one of them is ever \\
A sock that I hate

8 August 2012

High into the air \\
Landing before we know it \\
A short airplane flight

9 August 2012

Dinner with a friend \\
After eating way too much \\
Walk to burn it off

10 August 2012

Delta's distant voice \\
There's no flight for me today \\
Rescue me, Amtrak

\newpage

11 August 2012

Thoughts turning to kale \\
Strong, leafy vegetable \\
Full of nutrients

12 August 2012

Joy that clean sheets bring \\
Crisp and cool yet warm, inviting \\
Lull into slumber

13 August 2012

Cutting oneself, bad. \\
Cut when there is vinegar? \\
It's just that much worse

14 August 2012

On the way to work \\
Reading a book; words enter \\
Sticking to my mind

15 August 2012

Sticking yet not stuck \\
Hold with firmness, yields with touch \\
Masking tape. I'm bored.

16 August 2012

Cereal. Say it. \\
Soft and flowing, a whisper \\
Not crunchy, tinkle

17 August 2012

Tonight, I go out! \\
But movies here, and take out. \\
Lure into staying

\newpage

18 August 2012

The past ten minutes \\
The band in the park has played \\
The same four phrases

19 August 2012

I need more gumption \\
Every weekend morning \\
Results in sleeping

20 August 2012

An amusing graph \\
Up on my cubicle wall \\
Always makes me laugh

21 August 2012

There is sometimes in \\
Work, relaxation; the mind \\
focused --- unburdened

22 August 2012

Brief cacophony \\
Sudden, and then it is gone \\
The neighborhood still

23 August 2012

Weird noises from pipes \\
Now how I want to wake up \\
Be calm there, shower

24 August 2012

Cutting board, wood grain \\
Grooves from a thousand cuts stack \\
Worn away by time

\newpage

25 August 2012

Thinking of objects \\
And more objects of objects \\
Then my mind objects

26 August 2012

First, not enough tape \\
And then, after buying some \\
I find seven rolls

27 August 2012

The Hudson calms me \\
Placid waters drain my stress; \\
Breeze invigorates

28 August 2012

Students have returned \\
And they are all in my way \\
Grumpy old man mode

29 August 2012

Three balloons escape \\
Denied freedom for so long \\
Go stratospheric

30 August 2012

Thumper, not booting \\
Oracle tech replaces \\
Nearly everything

31 August 2012

Today I crave Fall: \\
Cooler weather, harvest foods \\
Hot cider, doughnuts
