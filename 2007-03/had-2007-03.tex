I'm drinking coffee at the Ugly Mug in Ypsi on a
cool April evening. Okay, it's a bit cold here, but
in Michigan, like in all states, if you don't like
the weather, just wait a week. They are having
fun with the cranky stereo here --- they play neat
tunes here, but the speakers the sound comes out are
kind of random.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated.

To the Place of Hats! \\
I need a mitre, toot sweet \\
Why don't you have them?

2 March 2007

To the Elbow Room \\
Music from four bands playing \\
A relaxing night

3 March 2007

A power struggle \\
Laptop lacking in energy \\
And no outlets near

4 March 2007

Turning, gnashing gears \\
Grinding, tearing through metal \\
My beans are opened.

\newpage

5 March 2007

Sleepy slumber tire  \\
Stumble awake clock ire \\
Set all on fire

6 March 2007

My kitchen needs swept \\
My popcorn popper spraying \\
Does not help matters

7 March 2007

All that could be solved \\
Given a spherical cow \\
The mind just boggles

8 March 2007

Swirling down the drain \\
The water from dishes flees \\
And plates grow shiny

9 March 2007

A package of books \\
New delights come by the post \\
A P.O. Box gift

10 March 2007

Flow away winter \\
Your snow drains to the river \\
Rest until next time

11 March 2007

Late coffee foiled \\
First the Mug closes at nine \\
Then a machine dies

\newpage

12 March 2007

Shake vigorously \\
My television commands \\
Else it does not work

13 March 2007

Walk along, evening \\
Amble as the streets grow dark \\
Fade away, fair sun.

14 March 2007

Window shades graceful-- \\
ly dance as the cool night breeze \\
Comes in the window

15 March 2007

I need beans, real quick \\
A source of iron, they say \\
I lack energy

16 March 2007

In the back, hipsters \\
Arguing about honey \\
Creating a buzz

17 March 2007

Big Pimpin' spending Gs \\
Big Pimpin' P I M P \\
Big Pimpin' spending Gs

18 March 2007

In my living room \\
Books strewn across the table \\
Debris of my mind


\newpage
19 March 2007

Shopping carts rattle \\
I offer my groceries \\
Beep, goes the scanner

20 March 2007

Cake, I love you, cake \\
Soft, with frosting, on my plate \\
Eat before it's late

21 March 2007

Ambulate around \\
The apartment parking lot \\
A ten minute walk

22 March 2007

Flashing silver arc \\
A squawk, a splash, a landing \\
Geese out on the pond

23 March 2007

In Legless Valley \\
The One Legged Ass-Kicker \\
Rules as if a king

24 March 2007

Royal Oak Journey \\
Amble, buy books, drink coffee \\
Dinner with Shadow

25 March 2007

Trees whisper nightly \\
The secrets of the soil \\
If you just listen

\newpage

26 March 2007

First ride of the year \\
Down the block, sending some mail \\
It's been far too long

27 March 2007

Far off in the night \\
Sirens scream as they race by \\
To the hospital

28 March 2007

A wall-hugging pod \\
Glowing green, lurking softly \\
Charging batteries

29 March 2007

Cold, bitter journey \\
The photon jumps through space and \\
Twinkles in your eye

30 March 2007

Uniqname upgrade \\
The only thing we have to  \\
Fear is fear itself.

31 March 2007

In the 'Mug bathroom \\
Noam Chomsky watches me pee \\
I'm a bit creeped out
