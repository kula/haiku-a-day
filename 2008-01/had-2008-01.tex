A little late this month, but so goes life. It's
snowing up a storm in Ypsilanti as I write this,
and I want spring like a man on fire wants a 
bucket of water.

Or something like that.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 January 2008

Snow thickly covers \\
And sound across the city \\
Is muffled and dull

2 January 2008

A frigid blast wakes \\
Waking me from my doldrums \\
As I'm leaving work

3 January 2008

Snow crunches, I walk \\
The bus rumbles as it goes \\
And I seek coffee

\newpage

4 January 2008

A picture, frozen \\
Thaws out memories once lost \\
Washing me away

5 January 2008

Candle, burning bright \\
Standing strong against the night \\
Holding back the cold

6 January 2008

Pressure of the deep \\
Eons pass, and the darkness \\
Turning dirt to gems

7 January 2008

Wefting warping threads \\
Knotting and twisting become \\
The scarf that warms me

8 January 2008

The stuff of beaches \\
Suffered through an inferno \\
Makes my water glass

9 January 2008

Down with the atoms \\
Photons and electrons move \\
Defining our world

10 January 2008

Numbers infinite \\
Equations unlimited \\
Mathematical \

\newpage

11 January 2008

The apartment above \\
Must have a large pack of dogs \\
Ceaselessly running

12 January 2008

Potato, my potato \\
Fluffy, steamy, you split open \\
And become devine

13 January 2008

The rain at Elbel \\
Muting the sound of the game \\
Skids becoming goals

14 January 2008

Philosophical \\
My thoughts grow less topical \\
These words stalk you all

15 January 2008

Lyrical calming \\
Frozen brainstem enbalming \\
Slight-of-hand palming

16 January 2008

The lonesome whistle \\
Drifts across the snowy land \\
Tugging my heart home

17 January 2008

I love pineapple \\
Although I used to hate it \\
When I was little


\newpage

18 January 2008

Old bricks stand exposed \\
Steel beams arching overhead \\
My coffee grows cold

19 January 2008

A giant bestrides \\
The hill where water goes high. \\
Stony, silent, cold

20 January 2008

A crystal of ice \\
Bouncing in the atmosphere \\
Dancing in the wind

21 January 2008

Consumed by info \\
The brain escapes far away \\
To a happy place 

22 January 2008

A river of ice \\
Born beneath a thousand feet \\
Slithers in the snow

23 January 2008

The light, grey and pink \\
Filters through the snow falling \\
Glowing in the dark

24 January 2008

The city in the dark \\
The close streets comforting me \\
I walk through the night


\newpage 

25 January 2008

Ideas in my head \\
Concepts bouncing all around \\
Words flowing freely

26 January 2008

Do you see the Sun? \\
Easing into the new day \\
Racing through the sky

27 January 2008

Howling, the wind screams \\
Filling my heart with madness \\
As I try to sleep

28 January 2008

A'choo explosion \\
Blasting open the quiet \\
I sniffle at work

29 January 2008

As macaroni falls \\
I curse myself and all life \\
Sigh, and start to sweep

30 January 2008

A hot, murky depth \\
From which rises hard metal \\
I rinse silverware 

31 January 2008

Pillow, o pillow! \\
Your sweet embrace holds my head \\
You soften the night
