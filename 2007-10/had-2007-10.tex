Ontime this month, I hope --- It's the $3^{rd}$ and early
in the morning (for a Saturday, at least) and I'm getting
ready to go photocopy and go to the post office. We'll see
how it goes.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

Wash away the lights \\
Rain in streaks and in puddles \\
Falling from the sky

Grey people walking \\
Walking, leaving no path \\
I am one of them

My addiction hard \\
A few days without caffiene \\
Hurting my poor head

My clock glows, and in \\
Glowing reminds me that I'm \\
Awake at this time

5 October 2007

A night of good sleep \\
I'm so glad you have returned \\
And made me happy.

6 October 2007

It's morning again \\
In Ypsilanti, and sane \\
People make some tea

It's evening again \\
In Ypsilanti, and sane \\
People eat popcorn

Squares alternating \\
Royalty safely behind \\
While pawns dance out front 

9 October 2007

Glistening bottle \\
A syrup full of flavor \\
Tasty on waffles

A monolith forms \\
With an evil robot mind \\
And hard, grippy arms

Lyrical gangster \\
Ripping beats like year old sheets \\
My rhymes can't compete

Grey cotton blankets \\
Spreading across a cool sky \\
Covering the Earth

13 October 2007

Of my pocket calc \\
I am the operator \\
Adding, subtracting

A mess of wires \\
Tangled, messy, in a box \\
Twisting what I need

Errand forgotten \\
I need a trip to the store \\
To buy some stickers

Waters whisper low \\
Quietly greeting small rocks \\
As they pass on by

Bright orange in color, bumpy \\
I trip over you

A strand of fine glass \\
Lit through with coherent light \\
Speed of light info

In the afternoon \\
Barking filters through the air \\
Dogs enjoy the day

Outside my window \\
Bushes rustle in the wind \\
As trees shed their leaves

22 October 2007

Warming up some soup \\
I see I'm out of crackers \\
And I curse the Gods

23 October 2007

Reload. Click. Reload. \\
Why am I reloading this? \\
OKCupid hate.

24 October 2007

I love cold weather \\
And making a warm bundle \\
Strong against nature

A thick envelope \\
There's nothing better than mail \\
To cheer oneself up

The bearded lady \\
Keeping the sound optimal \\
And the bands in line

27 October 2007

Asphyxiation \\
Dreaded blood in glassy eggs \\
One more Ypsi night

28 October 2007

The magic of rice \\
Hard kernels transformed to soft \\
By heat and water

I think I'll stop at \\
One impossible problem \\
Solved each day at work

Bike this egg around the square \\
And do not break it

Candy night tonight \\
Apparently. I'm having \\
Tea at Ugly Mug
