Well, folks, I finally got the gumption to pack
up my infrastructure and move 500 miles away to
Ypsilanti, MI, to take a job at the University
of Michigan in Ann Arbor. After 28 years of
being an Iowa, I'm now a Michiganer (I guess).
I've already verifed with my new boss that I will
not be required to point to where in the mitten
I live.

Surprisingly, my entire infrastructure made it
out, in one form or the other, and my car did
not explode on the way out (my father and brother
were taking bets on how far it would make it).
I'm sure I'll be unpacking for a long time, but
I'm getting settled in, and tomorrow go in for 
my first day of work.

So, if you ever find yourself in the Ypsilanti/
Ann Arbor area, be sure to drop me a line.

Downloadable version available at website, or if you really
want me to send you one, send me your address, maybe a
stamp too. I enjoy getting mail as much as I enjoy sending
mail. Of course, I have no idea what my address may be at
this point....
