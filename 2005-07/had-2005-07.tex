In June of 2005 I was at a conference in Pittsburgh
and used the opportunity to visit one of the best
bookstores in the world (Copacetic Comics). 
There I picked up a copy
of the first of Snakepit anthology,
a collection of the daily comics Ben Snakepit
decided to start drawing back in 2000/2001.

Reading it late at night, I had the idea
to do something similar: write a haiku a
day, collect them up at the end of the month,
and send them to friends. While I don't
mean for it to be a diary (like Ben's comic
is), what you have in your hands sometimes
reflects what was happening that day, or
what I happened to be thinking about.
Not intentionally, but it happens.

Note to purists: while the Japanese poem
form known as the Haiku has more behind it
than the 5/7/5 syllable form, that's all
I'm using it for.

Enjoy.
