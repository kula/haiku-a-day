New month, new Haiku a Day. Fall is near, and I can almost taste
the apple cider.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 August 2009

A storm, nothing \\
An industrial specter \\
I watch from a chair

2 August 2009

Don't you try it, punk \\
Steal my bike, get a beatdown \\
Your karma tarnished

3 August 2009

Sleep late, still tired \\
The week just new already \\
Promises to blow

\newpage

4 August 2009

Stickers that don't peel \\
Making my life difficult \\
A needle helps out

5 August 2009

If you cease to fork \\
This library will screw you \\
It gives me much pain

6 August 2009

Dream reality \\
Beating real reality \\
The brain playing tricks

7 August 2009

Late night restarting \\
Servers getting upgraded \\
AFS runs smooth
 
 8 August 2009

 Cleaning the kitchen \\
 A fine thing for one to do \\
 But then dirty it?

 9 August 2009

 Holing up today \\
 AC on, dim lit reading \\
 A cave of coolness

 10 August 2009

 Cold fingers clasping \\
 Open and close, bend and fold \\
 Without me, doors stick


\newpage

11 August 2009

Packets, screaming, slam \\
A network out of its mind \\
My island, battered

12 August 2009

A picture conveys \\
Words describe what is hidden \\
Both here devastate

13 August 2009

That shelf, once a tree \\
That tree, once naught but a seed \\
That seed, once a star

14 August 2009

Friday afternoon \\
Nothing done, nothing to do \\
The weekend, lets go!

15 August 2009

Early morning gump \\
Quickly halts from a breakdown \\
So I take a nap

16 August 2009

Carpet fuzzies roam \\
In that under-slumber land \\
Dark, unknown, hidden

17 August 2009

This week, I don't know \\
I'm not sure I'm feeling it \\
The weekend, far off

\newpage


18 August 2009

Doctor Krakers cures \\
The hunger growing hours \\
His crunch is your cure

19 August 2009

Sometimes force gives strength \\
Other times it brings ruin \\
Do not confuse them

20 August 2009

The throwdown happens \\
Mad haters dising the Mug \\
Scoring stupidly

21 August 2009

Having urges to \\
Do some weird networking stuff \\
Thankfully, I stop

22 August 2009

It takes but a glitch \\
Many find their day ruined \\
At MACC twice today

23 August 2009

Starting as an itch \\
Then a fever joins the fun \\
Coughing, oh what fun

24 August 2009

Staying home today \\
Sleeping for hours, and then \\
Laundry, oh what fun


\newpage

25 August 2009

A sudden craving \\
Ice cream, waffle cone, two scoops \\
Where did that come from?

26 August 2009

A twist, a turn, fold \\
Once flat, boring, regular \\
Now a complex form

27 August 2009

A hint, trees turning \\
Whisper that fall is coming \\
``No summer!'' I shout

28 August 2009

Summer never came \\
And a torrent of water \\
Washes up for fall

29 August 2009

Threads unraveling \\
Order into disorder \\
I need some new socks

30 August 2009

So much is built on \\
A chemical reaction \\
Liquid becomes stone

31 August 2009

Outside the sky dims \\
And pockts of light turn on \\
My heart grows brighter
