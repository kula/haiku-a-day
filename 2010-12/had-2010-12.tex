Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 December 2010

Where did this year go? \\
It's already December. \\
Can we add a month?

2 December 2010

Clear complexity \\
From simple things comes chaos \\
Of absurd degree

3 December 2010

The weekend, heavy \\
Full of opportunities \\
Work, or do nothing?


\newpage

4 December 2010

So much left to do \\
Before the year is finished \\
Let's get down to work!

5 December 2010

Cold window, drafty \\
Hot chocolate keeps me warm \\
Safe from outside chill

6 December 2010

In a river, mud \\
Squishing ooze between our toes \\
Baked, hard under feet

7 December 2010

Snap into focus --- \\
Work drawn out, now aligning, \\
Fuzzy outlines sharp

8 December 2010

A bean, kidney red \\
Swimming in a sauce piquant \\
Luscious over rice

9 December 2010

Ascending the stairs \\
The people turn, and look back \\
Before they go in

10 December 2010

Purple, like eggplant, \\
Great shiny orb, softly sits. \\
Why is it tasty?

\newpage

11 December 2010

Torchlight procession \\
The threat of impending rain \\
The most fun ever

12 December 2010

Winter's grey rainfalls \\
Dampen ground still unfrozen \\
Faint pitter-patter

13 December 2010

I've become proficient \\
Tearing apart my car dash \\
I need a new car

14 December 2010

Neologisms \\
Sometimes just fall from my mouth \\
Self dictionary

15 December 2010

Hip cats swing coolly \\
While jazz heats up the night air \\
In red, she dances

16 December 2010

Registration grooves \\
Laser cut in metal cold \\
Line up to measure

17 December 2010

A great disturbance \\
As if a trillion atoms \\
Became a taco

\newpage

18 December 2010

Branding: disturbing \\
Cacophony of nonsense  \\
Tell me what you do

19 December 2010

Where did the time go? \\
There is so much left to do. \\
The end is nearing.

20 December 2010

Holding on the phone \\
Christmas music assaults me \\
My ears aren't jolly

21 December 2010

Last work day this year \\
Absolutely nothing done \\
Counting down hours

22 December 2010

Running all around \\
End of the year errands done \\
I hope for quiet

23 December 2010

Up at ass thirty \\
Stuffed into a tiny tube \\
Zooming through the air

24 December 2010

A day of nothing \\
I rejoice at sluggardness \\
Then take one more nap

\newpage

25 December 2010

Eating too much food \\
Means yet another nap time \\
Man, life is sure hard

26 December 2010

Hidden in daylight \\
Fog fills the land, softness reigns \\
And the world is small

27 December 2010

Glorious beauty \\
Back where there is real coffee \\
I weep with pure joy

28 December 2010

Glorious nothing \\
A week bare, nothing to do \\
Now what shall I do?

29 December 2010

Be out and about \\
Sometimes I want that, others \\
I hole up at home

30 December 2010

Sleeping wrong, my neck \\
Planning assassination \\
I need a new bed

31 December 2010

The washer, spinning \\
Like the Earth, new year soon \\
And here I launder
