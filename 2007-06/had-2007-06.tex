I write this on Canada Day, and a year ago I was just landing
at the Toronto Airport. Now I sit in Ypsilanti and blast
{\em O Canada}.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated.

1 June 2007

The cross walk fails me \\
I stand, pushing the button \\
But I can not pass

2 June 2007

In north Ann Arbor \\
The Hill of Death before me \\
The skies open up

3 June 2007

Couscous: miracle \\
Tiny pasta becoming \\
A tasty delight

4 June 2007

At the Bluish Barn \\
An evening of craftyness \\
There was bread pudding


\newpage

5 June 2007

Water is falling \\
Misting from the skies above \\
All Nature is damp

6 June 2007

A trip tomorrow \\
Means running around today \\
In preparation

7 June 2007

Minneapolis \\
A long journey by train ends \\
By a great river

8 June 2007

Duluth by the lake \\
Nestled along a hillside \\
Your arms around me

9 June 2007

Along Tischer Creek \\
Samantha and Kyle wed \\
Later Freebird plays

10 June 2007

Toes frozen at the \\
Shore of Lake Superior \\
As Sarah shows off

11 June 2007

A mournful whistle \\
I roll into Ann Arbor \\
And wave to the train


\newpage

12 June 2007

Along the sidewalk \\
Tracks across a muddy path \\
Grass struggles to grow

13 June 2007

Down the road from me \\
A field of cat-o-nine-tails \\
Strange rustling within

14 June 2007

Corny miracle \\
That so little becomes a \\
Mushroom polenta

15 Jun 2007

The weekend beckons \\
There are many things to do \\
But slothfulness reigns

16 June 2007

A fan's droning sound \\
The afternoon lullaby \\
As I take a nap

17 June 2007

A bit of scrubbing \\
A clean bike is happier \\
And it's shiny, too

18 June 2007

Good bye Punk Planet \\
Your magazine was good stuff \\
It will leave a hole


\newpage


19 Jun 2007

The evening ride home \\
Drops off a few blocks from home \\
A short walk ensues

20 June 2007

AFS backups \\
I need to do them again \\
Much thinking ahead

21 June 2007 

Chatting on the bus \\
As Ypsilanti goes by \\
On a summer day

22 June 2007

Show at the Elbow \\
Minor Planets rocking out \\
A CD is bought

23 June 2007

Vroom! Goes the vacuum \\
Sucking up carpet debris \\
And leaving fine tracks

24 June 2007

Powerlines above \\
Electromagnetic dance \\
Keeping the lights on 

25 June 2007 

Kittenpalooza \\
Advertised as I bus by \\
I giggle inside



\newpage

26 June 2007

Backups whizzing by \\
As rsync transfers data \\
I have warm fuzzies

27 June 2007

A perfect spiral \\
Phi: the golden ratio \\
Fibbonaci sum

28 June 2007

The drone of the fan \\
Muffles my laptop's music \\
Crank Stereolab

29 June 2007

Fractured rear mirror \\
Shows not where I am going \\
But where I have been

30 June 2007

At my apartment \\
A bird hopping through the mud \\
Where new grass will grow
