It's the season for apple cider, cool nights and long walks
with sweaters. The last nice bike rides of the season are
happening, and winter is waiting just around the corner.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 September 2009

Fall thuds into place \\
Shoving Summer, never here, \\
Even more aside

2 September 2009

Stuff begats more stuff \\
And an endless box parade \\
Marches by my door

\newpage

3 September 2009

Thursday morning burns \\
Dew from all the window shields \\
No excuse; to work

4 September 2009

What the hell's that noise? \\
Cats fight, or strange aliens. \\
I shut the window.

5 September 2009

Turn on all the lights \\
Let them hold back the darkness \\
Switch them off, go home

6 September 2009

Clean and clean some more \\
Make the apartment spiffy \\
Though it won't last

7 September 2009

What beauty, doughnuts \\
A simple ring of pure joy \\
Sublime yet tasty

8 September 2009

In my coffee mug \\
Echo of a thousand cups \\
Keeping me awake

9 September 2009

At the day's first light \\
I awake, and start to whine \\
Left the shades open


\newpage

10 September 2009

Oh headache, leave me \\
Your antics do not amuse \\
I want you to go

11 September 2009

Oh, apple cider! \\
Thy simplicity rings true \\
Nothing can compare

12 September 2009

Sun in the window \\ 
Interrupting my sweet nap \\
Curse and it remains

13 September 2009

Slender, pushed, twisted \\
The ka-chunk holds together \\
Things from the stapler

14 September 2009

Apartment straightened \\
If not neat, at least it's clean \\
That will do just fine

15 September 2009

Enough energy \\
Grocery shopping is done; \\
But not making food

16 September 2009

Raw numbers in code \\
Dangerous when not needed \\
I sigh and move on


\newpage

17 September 2009

My mind, wandering \\
Creates universes weird \\
Strange, unknowable

18 September 2009

To get a letter \\
Undertake a simple task \\
Just send a letter

19 September 2009

The simple beauty \\
Of a slice of break, toasted \\
Sublime majesty

20 September 2009

Here's how you do it \\
But the instructions don't work \\
This sign angers me

21 September 2009

Sleep schedule mess \\
Awake and sleepy mixed up \\
Caffeine does not fix

22 September 2009 

A sock do-si-does \\
Dancing with a pair of pants \\
Bowing to a shirt

23 September 2009

Dreary day today \\
The storm's parade rained on though \\
As the Sun peeks out


\newpage

24 September 2009

Flowers stare blindly \\
Unseeing, yet knowing fate \\
Their time will soon fade

25 September 2009

Five years of the Mug \\
There are ballons, and a cake \\
The perfect week cap

26 September 2009

Taco Tour Two \\
Bike across Ypsilanti \\
Six stops and then beer

27 September 2009

Tiny little hole \\
There at the side of the road \\
What's your mystery?

28 September 2009

Some words make no sense \\
Example: twitterpated \\
I just don't get it

29 September 2009

Tiny lights blinking \\
Flashing out a faint tattoo \\
Can you understand?

30 September 2009

Clean but not too clean \\
Don't look like a slob but don't \\
Act like that's your plan
