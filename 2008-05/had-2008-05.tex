Last evening, I visited the Dreamland Theater to listen to
Laura Barrett perform. Amazingly beautiful music, and I
highly recommend her CD {\em Earth Sciences}. You will not
be dissapointed. Afterwards Laura and her companion AJ
stayed around a bit and a group of us had a lovely chat
before they had to leave for NYC.

Things like this make me love this city.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 May 2008

Pizza with perverts \\
Where the phrase ``snowball fight" takes \\
A whole new meaning

2 May 2008

Thoughts of bookshelving \\
Whirling through my puny mind \\
Ideas flash and fade

3 May 2008

The banner is wrought \\
Paint and canvas, drying slow \\
Tomorrow it flies 

\newpage

4 May 2008

In Ypsilanti \\
Amazing people making \\
Awesome things happen

5 May 2008

Filling up with stuff \\
My apartment slowly goes \\
Into clutterness

6 May 2008

I awake refreshed \\
The sun shining warm, brightly \\
And life in the air

7 May 2008

Oh what pain it is \\
Having a lovely hammock \\
And only one tree

8 May 2008

Alas the pickle \\
Dropped on the floor becomes sad \\
No longer wanted

9 May 2008

With each tick the clock \\
Discards a second of time \\
Future, present, past

10 May 2008

The joy in filling \\
Empty bookcases makes me \\
Feel glad in my heart

\newpage

11 May 2008

Time passes slowly \\
Until I need it to stop \\
And zooming it goes

12 May 2008

I see the giant \\
Large, unmoving, and quiet \\
Before it wanders

13 May 2008

The Shelves of Weird hold \\
Mysteries from all over \\
Or junk that I have

14 May 2008

I'm craving a malt \\
I don't have the gumption to \\
Get ice cream right now

15 May 2008

Dust, floating slowly \\
A giant whirlwind moves \\
It tickles; I sneeze

16 May 2008 

The happiness from \\
A well made veggie spring roll \\
Is one of beauty

17 May 2008

Back and forth and back \\
Hauling crap I should throw out \\
I should use fire

\newpage

18 May 2008

Oh back! You hate me. \\
Hours of lifing stuff has \\
Really pissed you off.

19 May 2008

``Oh, just for a bit" \\
At the Corner Brewery \\
Turns into hours

20 May 2008

Newark, New Jersey \\
What more could this one say, than \\
Newark, New Jersey

21 May 2008

In cells I'm roaming \\
Traipsing across site to site \\
Meander and look

22 May 2008

Wandering New York \\
An hour spend searching for \\
Apple in a cube

23 May 2008

Hoboken I roam \\
An afternoon getting lost \\
Then some cheap pizza

24 May 2008

At home I arrive \\
The journey done, travels gone \\
Now once more I rest 


\newpage

25 May 2008

A day of crashes \\
My bike suffers at polo \\
And my body too

26 May 2008

Warm still air moves in \\
Breathing sultry hints of a  \\
Warm summer to come

27 May 2008

Frost tonight, they say \\
Perhaps that breathing was just \\
Summer's labored breath

28 May 2008

My life in boxes \\
Paths narrowly wandering \\
Don't unpack, make forts

29 May 2008

The breeze disturbing \\
The shade over the window \\
Wakes me up early

30 May 2008

I have made charcoal \\
I hate cleaning the oven \\
Can't robots do this?

31 May 2008

Totally done now \\
Boxes packed, hauled and lifted \\
And now to unpack
