So I was lazy this month, and am not getting this out
until the middle of February. Alas, such is how things
go in the exciting land of Ames. But, the wait was well
worth it, I posit, for this month we have groundbreaking
new territory in the field of haikus: goth emo haiku. See
if you can guess which one it is, and stay tuned next 
month to see: can we combine three genres in one haiku? 
Shall we try for, dare I suggest, {\em four}?
