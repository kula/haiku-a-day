Oh, the Amtrak fun I had visiting my parents for Christmas.
I'm sure I'll write it all up someday, but for now if you want
an entertaining story, find me sometime when you have fifteen
minutes.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 December 2007

The bright dark sky shines \\
With the light of the city \\
Glowing through the snow

2 December 2007

Annoying puddles \\
Rain collects where it should not \\
Thanks stupid landlord

3 December 2007

Oh my dear crockpot \\
Serving another tasty \\
I awake to you



\newpage

4 December 2007

The joy of a book \\
As I lay curled in bed \\
Pages unfolding

5 December 2007

A warm breath suffers \\
The air to become cloudy \\
A fog floats away

6 December 2007

In the morning light \\
I gaze at the sky and squint \\
Asking why I'm up

7 December 2007

Why do brain dumps fail? \\
The packet length is too long. \\
Why does that happen?

8 December 2007

Sweaters equal love \\
New ones found at a thrift store \\
Making me feel warm

9 December 2007

A lesson I've learned: \\
Espresso makes me mighty \\
At fixing weird code

10 December 2007

The love in bagels \\
So simple, pure and sublime \\
Round, holey beauty



\newpage

11 December 2007

A spark from heaven \\
Glinting in the cold night sky \\
Falls and quickly fades

12 December 2007

A ribbon of light \\
Slithering, halting, honking \\
Going nowhere fast

13 December 2007

As electrons dance \\
The world becomes glowing red \\
My bagel, toasted

14 December 2007

Too much junk, I say \\
Next year shall be clean out year \\
Well, I say that now

15 December 2007

In microcosms \\
The small grows into fullness \\
Large, unknowable

16 December 2007

Awake to a world \\
Covered in inches of snow \\
Too fluffy to pack

17 December 2007

The feel of paper \\
Smooth, in anticipation \\
For thoughts to come out



\newpage

18 December 2007

Four stories of books \\
Only an hour from me \\
I must not go there

19 December 2007

Smoke from a chimney \\
Curls into the night air \\
Far above my head

20 December 2007

Walking I notice \\
A leaf dancing before me \\
Its tree forgotten

21 December 2007

With a hurried rush \\
Errands all over the place \\
Before I take off

22 December 2007

Tonight I am an \\
Amtrak Distressed Passenger \\
Stuck in Chicago

23 December 2007

Stuck in Mount Pleasant \\
Until the snow at home stops \\
And my parents come

24 December 2007

Howling snow and wind \\
Part, causing the sky to clear \\
I end my journey

\newpage

25 December 2007

Those four deviled eggs \\
Delicious, but I should have \\
Let those last five be

26 December 2007

All day marathon \\
Of Mythbusters episodes \\
I veg out today

27 December 2007

The tunnel finished \\
The drift conquered, the well switch \\
Is now reachable

28 December 2007

Leaving Chicago \\
On a bus to Ann Arbor \\
Finally I'm home

29 December 2007

A week of travel \\
Drains me; Some quiet hours \\
at the Mug refresh

30 December 2007

Energy today \\
Up early, and productive \\
What is wrong with me? \\

31 December 2007

Should something something \\
I don't remember that song \\
Who really sings it?
