May has come and gone, and with it half of the people
in Ames. I love college campuses in the summer, they
are laid back, but the people there have a sense of
purpose.

Next month I will be in Toronto for the first 11 days
of July. Depending on how things work out, you may get
a treat from Canada next month.
