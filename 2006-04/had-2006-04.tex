The big news for me in April is a change in my job ---
I've moved from the help desk here at work to doing more
systems and lab management stuff. They'll decide in six
months exactly what my job description will be, which 
gives me six months, I guess, to make it what I want it
to be. I'm cautiously optimisic. At the very least, 
it's another six months I can stop thinking about how
to move the large amount of stuff that is in my house.
