Welcome to 3172! (Or, 2006, for those of you on boring
time.) I had a wonderful
vacation, taking the first week of the year off and
spending it with friends in Minneapolis and Duluth
(and, it being almost exactly five years since I've
been in Duluth, it had been way too long). But now
I'm back and productive, in a sense, and here's 
this month's issue.
