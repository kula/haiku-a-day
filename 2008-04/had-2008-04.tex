I'm mostly done moving into my new apartment in the Midtown neighborhood
of Ypsilanti. I absolutely love my new place --- it is close to the Ugly
Mug, to good Chinese and Mexian food, my favorite Coney, and a park,
downtown and pretty much things I like to do. There are few things that
make me happier than building and filling new bookcases.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 April 2008

People are morons \\
Even more so on this day \\
Why must they do this? 

2 April 2008

Will tulips yet grow? \\
As the ground is warming up, \\
And the worms dancing

\newpage

3 April 2008

Deep below, lava \\
Churns and stirs, rising, falling \\
Fires in the deep

4 April 2008

Wandering orbits
Comets dancing in the sky \\
Looping through cold space

5 April 2008

Corner Brewery 
Alive, the sounds of banjos \\
Funds for the Freighthouse

6 April 2008

Famished, exhausted \\
Scarfing down a bit sandwich \\
I'm sleeping early

7 April 2008

The waters bubble \\
Lapping at Riverside Park \\
Washing age away

8 April 2008

Tea, you give me life \\
On this world I could not be \\
But for this sweet drink

9 April 2008

A serene figure \\
Looking down from the bookcase \\
Frozen, ceramic

\newpage

10 April 2008

Water softly falls \\
To dampen the street below \\
Cars zooming along

11 April 2008

The sound of people \\
Enjoying the weekend's start \\
Filling me with calm

12 April 2008

An idea forming \\
Quickly grows, colors blossom \\
Go forth, laminate

13 April 2008

Bike polo today \\
I played a couple hours \\
I'm totally beat

14 April 2008

Wireless laundry \\
Soapy suds and internet \\
This is the future

15 April 2008

Why frost? Why why why? \\
It's the middle of April, \\
Won't you go away?

16 April 2008

Bibbling bubble \\
Babbling brook bounces between \\
Big blunted boulders

\newpage

17 April 2008

When pigs have been passed \\
The night flashes red and blue \\
As Joe runs a light

18 April 2008

The night draws open \\
A pot of tea is enjoyed \\
The breeze cools my drink

19 April 2008

The life of a worm \\
Chewing dirt, making tunnels \\
Wriggling in the ground

20 April 2008

Brothers Love and Hate \\
It looks like Hate is on top \\
Love wins in the end

21 April 2008

Tiny humming sounds \\
My fridge is staying chilly \\
It wants me to know

22 April 2008

In the small hours \\
The world is dark and quiet \\
And so far away

23 April 2008

Toast, glorious toast \\
Maillard explains, wires make, \\
You pop up in need

\newpage

24 April 2008

A zen frame of mind \\
Wandering across the new thoughts \\
Pondering strange forms.

25 April 2008

The bold weekend starts \\
Laying ahead of me, young \\
Ready to relax

26 April 2008

A day of bold plans \\
Gone to a comfy sofa \\
You steal my gumption

27 April 2008

Mallets don't belong \\
In some places my dear friends \\
Like in my front wheel

28 April 2008

A crafty mind thinks \\
A banner bright in my head \\
For canvas I seek

29 April 2008

Swirling bubbles swarm \\
Lifting dirt off of my shirts \\
Whisking it away

30 April 2008

Tomorrow I move \\
Thankfully I have a month \\
Since I've packed nothing
