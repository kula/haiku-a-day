The first real snow of the year is falling now in Ypsilanti,
falling wetly on the ground, making slush in the streets. I
rode my bicycle from the Ugly Mug back home and it was great.

If you happen to be in the Greater Ypsilanti Metroplex Area
on 6 December 2008, check out the Winter Shadow Art Fair at
the Corner Brewery. 12 hours, 40 artists, 9000 gallons of
beer. I'll be there selling zines, photo prints and custom
haiku.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 November 2008

Ideas change the world \\
Just look at the paperclip \\
Bent wire billions

2 November 2008

A week of nothing \\
Stretching ahead pointlessly \\
Resplendent, empty

\newpage

3 November 2008

Two heavy junk loads \\
I should throw most of this out \\
But I keep hauling

4 November 2008

A stroll to the poll \\
Voting done quick and easy \\
Now I drink coffee

5 November 2008

Carrier silent \\
Small lights no longer blinking \\
Reset DSL

6 November 2008

The smell of crunching \\
Yellow leaves fall around me \\
A carpet, fading

7 November 2008

A smokey mist floats \\
Hugging the ground, dampening \\
Fleeing from the sun

8 November 2008

The last junk resting \\
Snug and tight in a new place \\
When will I return?

9 November 2008

No polo today \\
But a visitor from far \\
Some go for coffee

\newpage

10 November 2008

First snow stuck today \\
Stuck in corners and ridges \\
Shadow before storm

11 November 2008

Dark skies, bitter cold \\
Stopping for a pot of tea \\
I am warm again

12 November 2008

Leaves litter the floor \\
Detritus shuffled by feet \\
Walking in the door

13 November 2008

Sierpi\'{n}ski, you curr \\
Your sieve has no area \\
This tetrix hollow

14 November 2008

Walk the other side \\
And find that it's the same side \\
A strip M\"{o}bius

15 November 2008

Popcorn, so tasty \\
Confusing simplicity \\
Why is it so good?

16 November 2008

Tiny vibrations \\
Miniscule, an endless grove \\
A record crackles

\newpage

17 November 2008

Disorder explodes \\
A frantic night seeks simple \\
Vegetable soup

18 November 2008

In the sky so bright \\
Twilight stars glitter and gleam \\
Figures in the night

19 November 2008

Front counter pusher \\
Black gold instead of the red \\
Sweet Kenyan nectar

20 November 2008

That the word `napkin' \\
Has nothing to do with naps \\
Shows the messed up world

21 November 2008

The wind gaining speed \\
Stealing my breath, leaving me \\
Cold, huddled, alive

22 November 2008

Eternal cycle \\
Clean, dirty, clean, dirty, clean \\
I hate entropy

23 November 2008

The cyclists dispatched \\
The food gathered, donated \\
Hot cider was had

\newpage

24 November 2008

Quiet foreshadow \\
The slow trail up Mount Headache \\
The summit of pain

25 November 2008

Carrot cake lady \\
Oh yay, makes fruitcakes as well \\
My heart fills with joy!

26 November 2008

Time off emminent \\
And the will to work is gone \\
Nothing getting done

27 November 2008

An idea brewing \\
Leads to a kitchen monster \\
Dread quortanfurkey

28 November 2008

Plenty of caffeine \\
Allowing words to spill out \\
Typing all day long

29 November 2008

Bits constipated \\
Through the network slowly go \\
I want them faster

30 November 2008

Soft what snow falling \\
Lands upon the tired ground \\
Blanketing in white
