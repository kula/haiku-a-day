Today was supposed to be a simple day: clean a little bit, do some
errands, play bike polo, and put together this issue.
But no, our tape libraries decided to be dumb, meaning I've
been at work since 11am, kicking things. And, finally, around 4:30 pm
it looked like we had figured it out, and it was a simple fix, and all
I needed to do was go to our other facility on the south side of 
Ann Arbor and do the same thing. Long story short, I made smoke come 
out of our tape library and I'm waiting for IBM to show up. Hope you 
enjoy this month's issue.

you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 January 2009

Last vacation day \\
Tomorrow I go to work \\
No one will be there

2 January 2009

A green hobbit page \\
Everything is running well \\
Which makes me concerned

3 January 2009

Bits moving slowly \\
As I wait impatiently \\
I want them faster

\newpage

4 January 2009

No hubris, boasting \\
That I do not need full gloves \\
My fingers freeze off

5 January 2009

From the socket comes \\
Juice that's infintesimal \\
Electrons, screaming

6 January 2009

Plentiful bounty \\
Always lacking that one thing \\
It almost seems planned

7 January 2009

In the rush to leave \\
I forget at home my lunch \\
Today I eat out

8 January 2009

The battle is waged \\
The frontline: the door, and the \\
Enemy is slush

9 January 2009

I'm in the shower \\
When the pager starts to beep \\
Unserver pain

10 January 2009

A twist of thread hangs \\
From the arm of my sweater \\
Waiting to get caught

\newpage

11 January 2009

A mug of hot tea \\
Steam twisting in the sunlight \\
Centering, peaceful

12 January 2009

A dreadlock of cords \\
Cables twisted and knotted \\
An unruly mess

13 January 2009

How noble, popcorn \\
The stalky grass exploding \\
Kernels of delight

14 January 2009

The pile growing \\
Threatens to fall off the shelf \\
Oh, stupid junk mail

15 January 2009

The frigid weather \\
Making my hands dry and tough \\
Aligator skin

16 January 2009

In the afternoon \\
My brain addled with good food \\
I grow distracted

17 January 2009

Icicles of doom! \\
Hanging, biding out their time \\
Just waiting to strike

\newpage

18 January 2009

In the Thunderdrome \\
Herds of people freezing cold \\
Playing bike polo

19 January 2009

Creak like an old man \\
The knee sore, bending is hard \\
I lack but a cane

20 January 2009

Snow filling the ground \\
Filling the sky, filling life \\
Filling everything

21 January 2009

A loud car ambles \\
Down the street, turns, then silence \\
Dog barking afar

22 January 2009

Things snap into place \\
Code running fast, debugging \\
And more is what's left

23 January 2009

I see the glowing \\
Glowing glowing city lights \\
Stain the sky above


24 January 2009

I awake to birds \\
A bright sky, longing for spring \\
The end of winter

\newpage

25 January 2009

Dull sinus pressure \\
I'm thinking amputation \\
That might hurt a bit

26 January 2009

Type A bus driver \\
Spastic, too fastic, crazy \\
Get out of our way

27 January 2009

I'm an idiot \\
Stupid mistake wasting time \\
Making me grumpy

28 January 2009

Tape driver crashing \\
Brings sadness to TSM \\
Backups are halted

29 January 2009

This week is worthless \\
Interruptions taunting me \\
Getting nothing done

30 January 2009

I can't get away \\
The pager beeping, I see \\
That things are broken

31 January 2009

The hours changing \\
As we escape winters grasp \\
The thought of spring dawns
