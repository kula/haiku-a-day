Iowa again, this time for my brother and (new) sister-in-law's wedding.
The day went smashingly, there was good weather and excellent cake.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 August 2010

A sandwich, layered \\
Towering tome of tasty \\
Laminar goodness

2 August 2010

Getting confused, stop \\
Simple things making no sense \\
Return tomorrow

3 August 2010

I will beat this thing \\
Oh yay, I have beat this thing! \\
Still have to beat this.

\newpage

4 August 2010

Cup, sitting lonely \\
Waiting for a saucer friend \\
Slowly growing cold

5 August 2010

This automation \\
Beating into submission \\
Things recalcitrant

6 August 2010

Like sand falling down \\
This hole, while getting undug \\
Goes but a trickle

7 August 2010

An album boring \\
Has the most sublime cover \\
The devil, hot dog

8 August 2010

There are two sevens \\
One in the morn, one evening \\
I picked the wrong one

9 August 2010

The cake, while tasty \\
Left over a knife to clean \\
A cutting mission

10 August 2010

Heat and pressure yields \\
Layered shiny, troubling \\
Too much, too little


\newpage

11 August 2010

Oh sweet sweet cupcake \\
While your frosting is pretty \\
Your filling tempts me

12 August 2010

One task now finished \\
Reveals three more yet to go \\
An endless slogging

13 August 2010

There is Thai for lunch \\
Then it is Thai for dinner \\
I'm okay with that

14 August 2010

I can see the days \\
Growing shorter with each week \\
Fall glowing closer

15 August 2010

Thin clouds, riding high, \\
Are no respite from the Sun; \\
The shade, welcoming

16 August 2010

The new toy delay \\
Waiting for delivery \\
Testing your patience

17 August 2010

An idea, bursting \\
Explosive, a problem solved \\
If it just made sense

\newpage

18 August 2010

Boop boop boop boop boop \\
Stuck in my head, the song goes \\
Boop boop boop boop boop

19 August 2010

Slowly the minutes \\
Marching forward to the past \\
Encircle hours

20 August 2010

Forward, back, around \\
Rotation becomes a line \\
I drive home from work

21 August 2010

A soft mist of rain \\
Clouding the entire day \\
Rare clarity shows

22 August 2010

That's where that book went \\
Nowhere close to a sane place \\
It's hiding from me

23 August 2010

Late night bike polo \\
Deep in the parking garage \\
Bright light in the dark

24 August 2010

A bowl of lentils \\
Whispers when my finger stirs \\
A sweet melody

\newpage

25 August 2010

Getting mail is fun \\
But it does not compare to \\
The fun of sending

26 August 2010

A cool breeze blowing \\
Causes dancing to break out \\
In the window shade

27 August 2010

Over and over \\
The same question, same answer \\
Stop asking me that

28 August 2010

Baking ensuing \\
Broadcasting a tempting smell \\
Through the apartment

29 August 2010

Our path meanders \\
All over Ypsilanti \\
Wanderers not lost

30 August 2010

Random road closings \\
A riot of orange appears \\
You're not getting there

31 August 2010

Procrastination \\
Tells me to pack tomorrow \\
Instead of tonight
