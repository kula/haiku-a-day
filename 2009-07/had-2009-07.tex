At work this morning \\
I blasted `O Canada' \\
I need a trip soon \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}2 July 2009\end{center}

A photon hits glass \\
It slows a bit, and bending \\
Leaves by a new path \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}3 July 2009\end{center}

A pleasant day had \\
Errands ran, a bit of rain \\
I love these days off \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}4 July 2009\end{center}

While in a parade \\
There is nothing finer than \\
Drive-through espresso \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}5 July 2009\end{center}

Metal forged, graceful \\
Curves describing a sharp arc \\
Force cuts, wickedly \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}6 July 2009\end{center}

What a pause it gives \\
Bits flowing by my control \\
I'm surprised it works \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}7 July 2009\end{center}

Not sure what I ate \\
But it knocked me out hardcore \\
I stay home today \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}8 July 2009\end{center}

People atwitter \\
Much ado about nothing \\
What's same is the change  \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}9 July 2009\end{center}

Tape, sticking to things \\
But not sticking to itself \\
My mind kinda hurts \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}10 July 2009\end{center}

Week draws to an end \\
Friday afternoon, work done \\
I just want to go \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}11 July 2009\end{center}

What more do I need? \\
Lists of things a mile long \\
And I forget one \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}12 July 2009\end{center}

With each turn a creak \\
Metal whines to be replaced \\
New bottom bracket \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}13 July 2009\end{center}

At the last minute \\
I do all of my best work \\
Focus, no dawdle \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}14 July 2009\end{center}

Network slow, grinding \\
Bits transfer lacklusterly \\
I need more bandwidth \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}15 July 2009\end{center}

The talk that one hears \\
When interesting folks meet \\
Music to my ears \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}16 July 2009\end{center}

It all snaps in place \\
Layout done, things lining up \\
I finish and sigh \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}17 July 2009\end{center}

Printing twenty-five \\
I notice the misspelling \\
How did that sneak through? \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}18 July 2009\end{center}

This day was well spent: \\
Twelve hours, forty artists \\
And a lot of beer \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}19 July 2009\end{center}

A year more living \\
All I do is make cupcakes \\
And get on with life \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}20 July 2009\end{center}

I hate computers \\
Which works out right in the end \\
Because they hate me \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}21 July 2009\end{center}

This module sucks \\
Multiple rx\_Init \\
It should not do that \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}22 July 2009\end{center}

In a basement damp \\
Water, shattered by a ball \\
Bike polo brings light \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}23 July 2009\end{center}

Sometimes I wonder: \\
Should I have stayed back in Ames? \\
It was right to leave \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}24 July 2009\end{center}

The nothing evening \\
Some tea, then holed up at home \\
Stuck in old man mode \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}25 July 2009\end{center}

Unexpected treat \\
A can of cashews, frozen \\
Tasty cold nuggets \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}26 July 2009\end{center}

Dishes in stages \\
The mind wanders, a sink done \\
A new way to clean \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}27 July 2009\end{center}

It is sad, really \\
Slept well, yet have no gumption \\
Do I need less sleep? \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}28 July 2009\end{center}

Down with pants, I say \\
Kilts are more comfortable \\
And easy to make \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}29 July 2009\end{center}

Mix CD promised \\
Months ago delivered now \\
Better late than not \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}30 July 2009\end{center}

Strategy, planning \\
Lines of defense on a map \\
Resist the zombies \\
}
\addresslabel[\small\sffamily]
{
\begin{center}31 July 2009\end{center}

Foamy, cold and black \\
Water dripping down the glass \\
Iced coffee, so good \\
}
