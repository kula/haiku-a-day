\newpage

There's a guy who runs a little juice cart randomly in my neighborhood: 
he squeezes various citrus juices in front of you, adds ice, you hand him
three bucks, you enjoy. It's gotten to the point now where I don't even
have to say anything, when I walk towards him, he automatically starts
cutting up grapefruit.

You will remember last month my description of the digital stroke my
computing infrastructure had in June. The one side-effect of this
that affects {\em Haiku a Day} is that the haiku for the 14th didn't
get backed up before the stroke occured, and I have no idea what it
was. So, it stands bare in mute testament to all the bits lost in the
past.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

{\bfseries Avocado Eggs }
\end{center}

Amusingly, my last recipe I included in the back of a {\em Haiku a Day} involved 
avocados. These are pretty easy, and despite my worries that cooked avocado becomes
bitter (I remember reading that somewhere), these turned out very well.

Take an avocado, split in half and remove the pit. Scoop out a little bit extra avocado flesh,
then crack open an egg and put it in the hole. Salt and pepper, bake in a low oven (250F)
until the egg is set how you like it.

You will either want to use small eggs, or perhaps separate the yolk from your egg and 
use that. Or not care that you get egg white all over your baking sheet.
