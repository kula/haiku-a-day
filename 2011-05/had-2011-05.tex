Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 May 2011

Where's my Wobbly pin? \\
The day I want to wear it \\
I can't find the thing

2 May 2011

Why, deviled eggs, why? \\
In my thoughts at 2 a.m. \\
You poison my mind

\newpage

3 May 2011

When did that happen? \\
I forget not just comings \\
But things that occured

4 May 2011

Oh, how I miss thee \\
The famed Veggie Super Dog \\
You are far away

5 May 2011

A soft glow, bright flare \\
White curls up, becomes grey \\
Words lost by fire

6 May 2011

And now what movie? \\
But that just sounds boring \\
Too many choices

7 May 2011

These bits don't mean that \\
Something else entirely \\
And now I'm confused

8 May 2011

How did this week fill? \\
Things to do every night \\
Means a busy life

9 May 2011

The awesome driver \\
Finds late night Mexican food \\
A post Gigi's trip

\newpage

10 May 2011

The thought of breakfast \\
Weighing heavily, a pause--- \\
Lunch time already

11 May 2011

The Sun and my bed \\
Should not be near each other \\
Curse the morning light

12 May 2011

Wee little quinoa \\
When cooked, tiny tails pop out \\
Indicate doneness

13 May 2011

Flaming Lips rock out \\
At the Filmore Theater \\
After, veggie dog

14 May 2011

New career perhaps? \\
Tend bar at boss' party \\
Cute gay guys give tips

15 May 2011

The lure of laundry \\
A faint, distant siren song \\
Defeated by sloth

16 May 2011

Some talk of robots --- \\
Silent on killer lasers \\
What nonsense is this?


\newpage

17 May 2011

Long walk in the rain \\
Washing all my thoughts away \\
The world is all right

18 May 2011

Let the mind empty \\
And there, in the void, calmly: \\
Just dream of tacos

19 May 2011

``Why yes, that's heavy" \\
Screaming, my big toe whimpers \\
Stupid bulky box

20 May 2011

A brilliant moon glows \\
A luminous cave of clouds \\
Providing a home

21 May 2011

To north Michigan \\
Or at least heading that way \\
Mt. Pleasant training

22 May 2011

At long last it ends \\
Weeks of business over \\
Now: not a damn thing

23 May 2011

Ersatz wishing well \\
Will pennies fill this pot hole? \\
My mission: find out


\newpage

24 May 2011

A search for lilac \\
Mind thinks it's where it isn't \\
Going in circles

25 May 2011

Bright yellow dry shell \\
Like a beacon, defiant \\
Grey rain batters in

26 May 2011

I stare, things make sense \\
I start to write them down so \\
They keep making sense

27 May 2011

Twelve-thousand days here \\
Seems more memorable than \\
A once a year thing

28 May 2011

The air, growing still \\
No longer cools; I relent: \\
Air conditioning

29 May 2011

Thunder strikes nearby \\
The pool, still cold, could use it \\
Instead, we grill out

30 May 2011

Alone at the Mug \\
An iced Americano \\
Is my company
