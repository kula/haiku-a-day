Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

I realize that last month I forgot to include the last haiku of
the month. Here it is now.

31 May 2011

`How?' is the question \\
Stuck at the top of the queue \\
`When?' will come later

1 June 2011

Summer's sweet perfume \\
Floats below the clear blue sky \\
Intoxicating

2 June 2011

The signal is low \\
Causing glitches and pauses \\
Need a new AP

\newpage

3 June 2011

Somewhere are staples \\
In a pile, I see them \\
But where's the pile?

4 June 2011

Wander for hours \\
Then Robyn singing at me \\
Really makes the day

5 June 2011

Eight billion degrees \\
Or at least it feels like it \\
Why is it so hot?

6 June 2011

Robots are coming \\
Their spinny arms set to kill \\
Water will save us

7 June 2011

Whinging behind me \\
Ruins my coffee shop chill \\
Just shut up there, dude

8 June 2011

In a room, I learn \\
A dude in Salt Lake City \\
Making slides go by

9 June 2011

Files uploading \\
Bits are taking forever \\
Give me more pipe, yo



\newpage

10 June 2011

Impromptu stir-fry \\
After hours of chatting \\
Ties off the evening

11 June 2011

Toothpaste and apples \\
Teach about taste perception \\
Plus, there is coffee

12 June 2011

Why do anything? \\
It is Sunday, take a nap. \\
And have some pizza.

13 June 2011

Fifteen types of gin \\
I don't think we are lacking \\
Perhaps it's too much

14 June 2011

Simple evening walk \\
As the world rushes by me \\
Move at my own pace

15 June 2011

Layers peeling back \\
The asphalt of years gone by \\
Ground up with much noise

16 June 2011

Buzzing bumblebees \\
Bouncing between bright blossoms \\
Become boisterous

\newpage

17 June 2011

Surreal and sublime? \\
Or self-pretentious bullshit? \\
Not sure, this movie

18 June 2011

Lazy summer day \\
And the bus passes, slowly \\
Waste no energy

19 June 2011

Bike grease on my hands \\
Worn like a badge of honor \\
Also, that's weak soap

20 June 2011

There will be clean clothes \\
Quarters, soap, time and gumption \\
I sit while it spins

21 June 2011

The urge for counting \\
Is tempered by too much stuff \\
Waiting for counting

22 June 2011

Middle of the week \\
And the end, too far away \\
Grumble to myself

23 June 2011

I can not name it \\
But the color on that car \\
Is simply awful

\newpage

24 June 2011

Some things make no sense \\
Like this stupid code, broken \\
In some stupid way

25 June 2011

Never seen this big \\
A movie watched in new light \\
Khaaaaaaan, one syllable

26 June 2011

Sabotage myself \\
With a bent fork, I'm flying \\
Sadly, no good scars

27 June 2011

Like the sands of time \\
With pressure, rocks become sand \\
Its passage softens

28 June 2011

I see skies of blue \\
Making me want to sing of \\
A wonderful world

29 June 2011

Such a tiny thing \\
A furious little sun \\
My laptop, too warm

30 June 2011

Stupid vendors are \\
Just me repeating myself \\
I hate all of them
