It's the first of November, and I'm off for a week. I plan to
sit around and do absolutely nothing.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 October 2008

Autumn comes quickly \\
In a snap; I rush to close \\
Windows long open

2 October 2008

Fuzzy through the air \\
Comes the next vice president \\
Fun to watch, at least

3 October 2008

Blur at twenty-four \\
What is stopped becomes motion \\
And then still again

\newpage

4 October 2008

Busy worker bee \\
Buzzing through my apartment \\
Lots of stuff is done

5 October 2008

Bike polo kicks ass! \\
Two good games, excellent play \\
And a ton of fun

6 October 2008

Click, drag, click, drag, click \\
Repetative editing \\
Bored out of my mind

7 October 2008

Gritty grains melted \\
Hot, incandescent, then cool \\
Becomes clear and smooth

8 October 2008

July tore fingers \\ 
October tries to mend them \\
Now I type funny

9 October 2008

Americano \\
Take a stack of newspapers \\
Sit in the corner

10 October 2008

Far whistles blowing \\
Two trains passing in the night \\
Want to tell the world

\newpage

11 October 2008

A race to the end \\
Random routes in the night time \\
Cider and doughnuts

12 October 2008

The blur of the day \\
Stops when you think about it \\
Who has time for that?

13 October 2008

Doughnut day today? \\
I'm afraid, did I miss it? \\
No, it is next week.

14 October 2008

vos dumps are too slow \\
And I keep losing my creds \\
localauth fixes

15 October 2008

A fan hums softly \\
Late in the fall; I wonder \\
When it goes away

16 October 2008

FD\_SETSIZE hate \\
glibc sucks major ass \\
I hate you, linux

17 October 2008

Espresso machine \\
Sitting sadly, not working \\
Side torn off, naked

\newpage


18 October 2008

Autumn's bold colors \\
Captured in a split second \\
A series of bits

19 October 2008

Corner Brewery \\
Waiting for the Fall Riders \\
Enjoying the breeze

20 October 2008

A bagel, perfect \\
A torus of toasty joy \\
Wonderful, sublime

21 October 2008

Haven in the dark \\
Light and warmth full of good smells \\
A sight to behold

22 October 2008

Frost hides in the shade \\
And the Sun, seeking it out \\
Enters dark corners

23 October 2008

Happy stripey socks \\
Color circles my ankle \\
Make my feet cheerful

24 October 2008

Holes in my sweater \\
Need patching before they grow \\
I must get some thread

\newpage


25 October 2008

Two trains in the night \\
A whailing cry, booming sounds \\
Then silence returns

26 October 2008

A line for cider \\
Stretches away from the mill \\
The wait is worth it

27 October 2008

The evening shattered \\
The howl of a leaf blower \\
Just use a damn rake

28 October 2008

Handfulls of paper \\
Stuffed away in old boxes \\
Bring back memories

29 October 2008

Walking in the dark \\
Crunching frost under my feet \\
Refreshing cold air

30 October 2008

Wheeler Park grows dark \\
A constellation of light \\
As cyclists race off

31 October 2008

Random anime \\
And then Army of Darkness \\
What a fine evening
