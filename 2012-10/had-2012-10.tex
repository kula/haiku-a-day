You know how it goes, end of the year, you're sick and a giant hurricane
decends on your town. Here they are, the latest if not quite freshest
haiku.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 October 2012

Hospital corners \\
Are my bedding obsession \\
This is new to me

2 October 2012

I want a rocket \\
And a trip to outer space \\
Where's my transporter?

3 October 2012

A visit from Mom \\
Means a flury of cleaning \\
I hope it's enough

\newpage

4 October 2012

After a long flight \\
Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop is \\
Where you go refuel

5 October 2012

If you seek cool winds \\
The Staten Island Ferry \\
Is where you should go

6 October 2012

If you visit me \\
One thing is undoubtable: \\
You will have a slice

7 October 2012

On a rainy day \\
In the financial district \\
Under umbrella

8 October 2012

The Air Train visits \\
All the Newark Terminals \\
Each one in sequence

9 October 2012

I thought ahead here \\
Taking the day off after \\
Having visitors

10 October 2012

At least a short week \\
Is all I have to endure. \\
Half way, already.

\newpage

11 October 2012 

It is amazing \\
This lady, subway, makeup. \\
I would smudge it all

12 October 2012

The basket, shifting \\
Holding bread, or holding fruit \\
No allegiances

13 October 2012

Yes, please, stand right there. \\
The top of the stairs is great. \\
None of us need move.

14 October 2012

You hear of dreadnaughts \\
Giant ships from days of yore --- \\
But not dreadsomethings.

15 October 2012

By dint of dinting \\
Something totally somethings \\
There is the result

16 October 2012

In this apartment \\
There are many envelopes \\
I never find them

17 October 2012

For a sick stomach \\
Milkshake of Magnesia \\
Worst doctor ever

\newpage

18 October 2012

Some rapid typing \\
Paused for prolonged head scratching \\
Figuring things out

19 October 2012

Aside from waking \\
Today isn't a bad day. \\
I just want more sleep.

20 October 2012

Everything still --- \\
A small breeze kisses the leaves \\
Who now love the ground

21 October 2012

A Roundabout Way \\
Is where I will live when I \\
Win the lottery.

22 October 2012

A small symmetry \\
Becoming a pattern, broke \\
One corner disturbed

23 October 2012

Cozy is the chair \\
With a hot drink, a good book \\
And an empty night

24 October 2012

A lamp, shining bright \\
Makes it so that I can see \\
But glares the TV

\newpage

25 October 2012

What harm is there in \\
A second doughnut today? \\
Tight pants tomorrow.

26 October 2012

I curse all coughing \
And noses that don't function \\
Stupid infections

27 October 2012

Apparently there's \\
A giant ass storm coming \\
I sleep off sickness

28 October 2012

With a giant storm \\
Nothing to do but wait and \\
Curse my stupid cold

29 October 2012

Lights over the park \\
Must mean a transformer's gone \\
Up in New Jersey

30 October 2012

Hey, fuck you Sandy \\
Can't keep the coffee shop down \\
Espresso and scoff

31 October 2012

Stopping and starting \\
Too tight to jostle around \\
The long bus to work
