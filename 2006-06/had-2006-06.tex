This edition of Haiku a Day is special for two reasons.
First, it is the 12th edition of HaD, so I've been doing
this for a year, starting with that first haiku on 6 July
2005.

Second, this is the first edition of Haiku a Day produced
outside of the United States. Right now I'm sitting in
the common room of the Canadiana Backpackers in Toronto,
Ontario, near the end of my vacation in Canada. While I
sadly must leave in a couple of days, I think I shall be
doing my best to come back soon.
