My poor laser printer decided it's time for it to lose its mind
randomly, and complain about paper. Needless to say, when one wants
to print a lot of things, it's a bit painful. 

It's 2013, and printing still sucks!

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

A cold window, a warm home \\
Hot cocoa, life's good
