Okay, so NaNoWriMo didn't go very far for me --- around 6000 words.
But, hey, that's 6000 words that had never existed before, so that
has to count for something.

It's cold outside, cold enough that there the little gear indicator
in my car lags considerably behind as I shift gears. Colder than
Dick Cheney's heart, that's how cold it is. But, hey, I'm wearing
a tuque that I was given at the Bohemian Poetry Slam tonight, so
I'm right as rain.

See you next month, and next year.

Enjoy.
