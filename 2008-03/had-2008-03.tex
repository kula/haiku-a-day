It promises to be in the mid 50s today, and sunny. Later,
there's five hours of banjo music. Could life get any 
better?

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 March 2008

Layers of paint hide \\
Years of time that pass on by \\
Hidden, locked away

2 March 2008

I am watching pie \\
And now I am craving pie \\
Damn you, Alton Brown

3 March 2008 

Benadryl sweet dreams \\
My aunt is evil and can \\
Turn night into day

\newpage

4 March 2008

Technology moves \\
And what was once a god is \\
Cast into the pit

5 March 2008

What words, forgotten? \\
What thoughts gone forever? \\
What dreams, dim and lost?

6 March 2008

Battery low, sad \\
Jitterbug electrons now \\
Dance a slow tempo

7 March 2008

A tiny bright star \\
Guiding me all the way home \\
Polaris, my light

8 March 2008

Short and stout teapot \\
See it there, handle and spout \\
Tip, and pour it out

9 March 2008

Soup! A Miracle! \\
Simple but complex. Tasty. \\
A pot of goodness!

10 March 2008

A lesson I've learned \\
Six post-midnight espressos \\
Really fucks your sleep

\newpage

11 March 2008

The Great Wofflelon \\
Elder god of clean bath towels \\
And fuzzy slippers

12 March 2008

Beacon in the sky \\
On the tower you give light \\
You say stay away

13 March 2008

Little wall standing strong \\
Struggling to hold back the earth \\
A flower pokes through

14 March 2008

Circle ratio \\
Irrational, transcendent- \\
al, easy as pi.

15 March 2008

Though the winds may blow \\
A fair spring day in my head \\
Sunshine and cloudless

16 March 2008

Yarn tightly twisted \\
Woven into a warm scarf \\
Flapping in the wind

17 March 2008

The paint peeling off \\
Reveals bricks from long ago \\
And layers of time

\newpage

18 March 2008

Off to Jupiter \\
And Beyond the Infinite \\
Good night, A. C. Clarke

19 March 2008

The disk to mirror \\
Has been dead since who knows when. \\
Shabby: suck acme.

20 March 2008

Spring in Michigan \\
One brief day of nice weather \\
Then tomorrow: snow

21 March 2008

Thick and stifleing \\
Snow falls from the sky above \\
Piling on the ground

22 March 2008 

The snow is melting \\
Rivulets become rivers \\
How lovely the splash

23 March 2008

In the sky a kite \\
Struggling, wanting a new life \\
Straining to break free

24 March 2008

Swiftly falling rock \\
Rolling, skipping, of the cliff \\
Flying to a splash

\newpage

25 March 2008

Seed laying dormant \\
Waiting for the right moment \\
Springing into life

26 March 2008

A robin flutters \\
Along the branches of a tree \\
I'm longing for Spring

27 March 2008

Pillow, softly sit \\
On the couch blankets pile \\
Warm, comfy sleep time

28 March 2008

The leaf that quenches \\
Hot or cold, a tasty treat \\
Tea: drink of the gods

29 March 2008

Parking lot biking \\
Testing out a new cycle \\
It hasn't broke yet

30 March 2008

The parking garage \\
Rings with the sound of polo \\
Watch your head, its short

31 March 2008

Thunder rolling through \\
Gentle rain falling softly \\
The Earth waking up
