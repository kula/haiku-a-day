Fall has arrived here in The People's Republic of Ames. Well,
mostly. Stupid 80 degree days keep popping up, but we're
beating them down as hard as well can. Fifty degree weather,
sweaters, fallen leaves and real apple cider: what more could
one want?

1 September 2006

French fry desire \\
Why do I crave those fried treats? \\
Oh sweet potato

2 September 2006

Tweet tweet little bird \\
Hopping outside my window \\
Look, and you are gone

3 September 2006

I am an earth worm \\
Eating leaves and pooping dirt \\
My butt recycles

4 September 2006

A cool night outside \\
Bugs twitter, traffic goes by \\
Patio people chat

5 September 2005

Loud night grows quiet \\
Rough concrete beneith my feet \\
A bus takes me home

6 September 2006

A damp sweat builds up \\
Moisture on an ice cream glass \\
It sweats so I don't.


\newpage

7 September 2006

Swirling hum of air \\
A fan propells air around \\
Artificial breeze
      
8 September 2006
      
Descending softly \\
A leaf flitters to the ground \\
Return to the Earth
      
9 September 2006
      
Old calendar hangs \\
You never know when oh-four \\
Might make its return
      
10 September 2006
      
Monsoon season starts \\
Rivers of rain on concrete \\ 
Seeking bare soil
      
11 September 2006
      
Oh, spaghetti night \\
You fill my heart with much joy \\
Need you more often
      
12 September 2006
      
Gliding on my bike \\
Flying along west Ames streets \\
The wind at my back


\newpage

13 September 2006

Rode hard yesterday \\
Why was I a speed junkie? \\
Because now I hurt.

14 September 2006
      
Dust on the ceiling \\
Stuff with a tenuous hold \\
Falls about my head
      
15 September 2006
      
When John Darnielle sings \\
You shut your mouth and listen \\
Do not talk out loud
      
16 September 2006
      
A monsoon of rain \\
Robert gives me a ride home \\
When the skies open
      
17 September 2006
      
Weekends are fun when \\
They aren't two long boring days \\
I need more gumption
      
18 September 2006
      
It's not the nineteenth? \\
Monday confusion fills me \\
My head is a blur


\newpage

19 September 2006

Mates of State rock me \\
Organs and drums, clear voices \\
A simple beauty

20 September 2006
      
A good concert brings \\
A wave of calm to my nerves \\
Peace and happiness
      
21 September 2006
      
Walk for a sammich \\
Cool days are here among us \\
My sweater is nice
      
22 September 2006
      
Oh, end of the week \\
Laid back friday afternoons \\
Prepare the weekend

New VAX aquired \\
Acad lives in a new home \\
Decade quest over
      
24 September 2006
      
The day following \\
Moving heavy computer \\
I'm a sore old man


\newpage

25 September 2006

"Shake vigorously" \\
Thus says my television \\
Magical glow box
      
26 September 2006
      
Refridgerator \\
Quiet humming in the night \\
You keep my food cold
      
27 September 2006
      
A mid-week car ride \\
To Minneapolis for \\
Harvey Danger show
      
28 September 2006
      
Ah, the sudden flu \\
I hate achy misery \\
Sleep will make it fine
      
29 September 2006
      
Sudden thunderstorm \\
Rain so thick you can not drive \\
Windshield wipers flick
      
30 September 2006
      
Hi, little mousey \\
You don't belong in my house \\
I sweep you outside
