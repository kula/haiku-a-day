\newpage

Well, that was quick. I've accepted a job at the Columbia University Libraries, 
and am moving to NYC the end of October. Now I just have to get rid of 60\% of
everything I own....

New address coming soon --- stay tuned in a couple issues.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.

1 August 2011

Awake? This hour? \\
What nonsense must I suffer? \\
Going to work sucks

2 August 2011

Printmaking research \\
Always at the last minute \\
Will I get this done?

3 August 2011

In my apartment \\
I have a tool to fix that \\
If I can find it

\newpage

4 August 2011

We are all star stuff \\
Ancient bits became our lives \\
It's why I don't dust

5 August 2011

Tiny little box \\
Grabs interent from the air \\
And gives it to me

6 August 2011

Slot for everything \\
And everything in its slot \\
A box full of books

7 August 2011

Hate being meta \\
But what I hate even more \\
Is meta meta

8 August 2011

In a tiny cup \\
Is a tiny coffee drink \\
Oh, Macchiato

9 August 2011

Off in the distance \\
I hear a trumpet playing \\
It's eight a.m., dude

10 August 2011

Fastest thing ever \\
Bends in the presence of glass \\
A strange world it is

\newpage

11 August 2011

Craving apple juice \\
A late night trip to the store \\
You are weird, stomach

12 August 2011

Counting down minutes \\
A slow night, then reading \\
Relax before bed

13 August 2011

Deny miracles? \\
Then consider ranch dressing. \\
Where did that come from?

14 August 2011

Bending, yet stays straight \\
Coiled tension holds my place \\
Spring closes the door

15 August 2011

A shoe, tells my toe, \\
``I wouldn't stub you if you \\
sometime cleaned this place."

16 August 2011

The lure of French fries \\
Coming strong at three o'clock \\
Is sadly ignored

17 August 2011

Mailbox guardians \\
A spider watches letters --- \\
I cannot dislodge


\newpage

18 August 2011

Honk In honk the honk \\
Distance honk a honk car honk \\
Alarm honk goes honk

19 August 2011

What short life, the leaf \\
Factories of chlorophyll \\
Trees breathe so we breathe

20 August 2011

Outside: loud people \\
Students must be returning \\
Get out of my town

21 August 2011

At just the wrong time \\
The front door and my knee meet \\
Not a happy time

22 August 2011

Who is the Speed Queen? \\
In the Laundromat Kingdom, \\
Does she reign supreme?

23 August 2011

A puzzle revealed \\
When I have an espresso \\
I love you, caffeine

24 August 2011

Light beam, diffraction \\
Bits of glass reveal color \\
White becomes multi


\newpage

25 August 2011

Packing is easy \\
When you don't think about it \\
Just throw stuff in bag

26 August 2011

The land of Des Plaines \\
The smell of pizza wafting \\
Making me hungry

27 August 2011

Iowa: Surprise! \\
Mom can't believe that I'm here \\
Happy birthday, aunt

28 August 2011

Cleaning up today \\
Party debris from last night \\
The cake is all gone

29 August 2011

Iowa, Chicago \\
Stop at Wormhole for coffee \\
Then Ypsilanti

30 August 2011

Another day gone \\
As the Sun sets in the west \\
I go for a walk

31 August 2011

Very flimsy chair \\
Lawn furniture, laundromat \\
A picnic, with clothes
