If intertia is the key guiding factor in my life, procrastination is 
it's formost way of expressing itself. This month I'll be at the
Shadow Art Fair, 18 July 2009 at the Corner Brewery in Ypsilanti.
12 hours, 40 artists, 9000 gallons of beer. It kicks ass, and you
should be there.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out your own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 June 2009

To Lake Orion \\
In the middle of nowhere \\
I buy a new bike

2 June 2009

On this flight they serve \\
Those little bags of peanuts \\
I thought that was dead

\newpage


3 June 2009

In case of earthquake \\
We are told where we should go \\
The ground does not shake

4 June 2009

The SLAC Research Lab: \\
``Unique Hazards May Exist" \\
I'd buy that t-shirt

5 June 2009

Fire in the air \\
A transformer all alit \\
Causes some panic

6 June 2009

The city beckons \\
And I sucumb to its charms \\
It draws me; I walk

7 June 2009

Flying, we defer \\
Now in first class we're riding \\
Be nice to gate clerks

8 June 2009

Sleep schedule messed up \\
Tomorrow I'll pay for it \\
But today I nap

9 June 2009

Returning to work \\
I wonder what I do here \\
Slogging through e-mails


\newpage

10 June 2009

Parts accumulate \\
In a box they sit, tempting \\
``Make something with me"

11 June 2009

Mary stands, looking \\
Stone still over a small park \\
Ignoring traffic

12 June 2009

Tree fluff floating down \\
A mirror of the winter past \\
This snow is not cold

13 June 2009

Like a campfire \\
But more fragrant, the smell of \\
Coffee beans roasting

14 June 2009

A sink, clean, empty \\
A rare sight these hectic days \\
Bright steel oasis

15 June 2009

Sullen IT folks \\
In a courtyard, drinking beer \\
A merger cometh

16 June 2009

Down the street walking \\
I see Ahmadinejad \\
No, it's just some guy

\newpage

17 June 2009

Tiny rocks, polished \\
Surrounding a tree; I stare \\
Waiting for the bus

18 June 2009

Old guy biking by \
Meandering down the walk \\
Ignoring the world

19 June 2009

Guy smoking out front \\
Takes a shot of espresso \\
Needs more stimulus

20 June 2009

Fifth ginger beer batch \\
Sucanat and some spices \\
Interesting taste

21 June 2009

This voice annoys me \\
Scratching across the blackboard \\
Lodged in my poor mind

22 June 2009

Words make images \\
Flash on the screen of the mind \\
Curtain drawn, I sleep

23 June 2009

Procrastination \\
Delays in stuff I need done \\
Worry tomorrow


\newpage

24 June 2009

A box of q-tips \\
Made in the United States \\
Packed in India

25 June 2009

Sitting innocent \\
The box I stub my toe on \\
``Oh, did I do that?"

26 June 2009

At the last moment \\
Everything thrown together \\
Living room suffers

27 June 2009

They ride, they collect \\
Some eight-hundred fifteen pounds \\
For Food Gatherers

28 June 2009

Sitting, cool, I write \\
Drink coffee, discuss zombies \\
Sunday at the Mug

29 June 2009

I'm still sore today \\
Must have been some good matches \\
When I ache this late

30 June 2009

The world grows fuzzy \\
``I must act!" blur swish wish wash \\
My glasses are clean
