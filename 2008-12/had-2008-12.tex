Here in Ypsilanti we have inches of snow on the ground, and
inches more on the way. It's cold and windy outside, so brave
the journey to the mailbox to pick up this month's issue, but
then, go back inside, kick back and have a warm tasty beverage.
There, you feel better already, don't you?

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 December 2008

With icy scrapes I \\
Push around soft white snowfall \\
Annoying grinding

2 December 2008

Repetative thunk \\
The stapler pushing wire \\
Binding up pages

3 December 2008

Why is pickles the \\
First random word I think of? \\
How does my mind work?

\newpage

4 December 2008

A trip to the store \\
Yielding random rubber stamps \\
Makes me glow happy

5 December 2008

Enough candy to choke \\
A medium sized pony \\
Sitting in a bowl

6 December 2008

I want nothing more \\
Than to sit for ten hours; \\
Saints lend me a chair

7 December 2008

Living room, once clean \\
Is filled again with boxes \\
A scourge in my life

8 December 2008

In sweaters, comfort \\
Wrapped in warmth, the world at bay \\
You find at last peace

9 December 2008

Recliner, hold me \\
At the end of a long day \\
You are there for me

10 December 2008

It happens each year \\
The first bad roads and people \\
Forget how to drive


\newpage

11 December 2008

In the basement a \\
Fiery furnace glowing hot \\
Keeping the house warm

12 December 2008

A restless evening \\
Boredom strikes, and not shaken \\
Slows the hours, dull

13 December 2008

My internal map \\
Is a bit inaccurate \\
I drive in circles

14 December 2008

Old TV programs \\
Drag me into a deep pit \\
Waste the day away

15 December 2008

Waiting for the bus \\
Watching the wind blow paper \\
Down an empty street

16 December 2008

The city rolls by \\
Dilligent students study  \\
For final exams

17 December 2008

The black faded brown \\
A ribbon stretched, torn, tattered \\
I need a new hat

\newpage

18 December 2008

At the first sign of \\
boredom I scream ``You will not \\
get me!'' and sit down

19 December 2008

Grey, silent, hulking \\
Clouds hover as they drop snow \\
I sit inside, warm

20 December 2008

Everyone wants \\
To be where I want to be \\
Get out of my way

21 December 2008

Why are these cookies  \\
So damn tasty? Their siren \\
Song lures me to eat

22 December 2008

Sitting here at work \\
The day before vacation \\
I get nothing done

23 December 2008

Bernoulli screaming \\
As air whipping past the wing \\
Provides us with lift

24 December 2008

Crazy family \\
Growing more goofy each year \\
Makes the mind boggle


\newpage

25 December 2008

Seeping and seeking \\
What was once inside a pipe \\
Leaks into the ground

26 December 2008

Dampness and wires \\
Current flows where it shouldn't \\
I throw the pliers

27 December 2008

Fluffy sweaters press \\
Squished between some socks and shirts \\
Will it all fit in?

28 December 2008

Frost gleaming, glowing \\
Brightly in the morning light \\
Melting it away

29 December 2008

Inconsequential \\
Light as air, transforms itself \\
Slams across the ground

30 December 2008

The kernel grinding \\
Compiling, system building \\
Waste time while I wait

31 December 2008

An extra second! \\
Leaps us into the New Year \\
As the Earth slows down
