Back to the normal format this month. I find myself craving
apple cider and cooler weather, which means I'm looking forward
to fall. With fall, of course, comes the annual migration of
students back to the area. While I'll miss the quiet of summer,
no lines and fewer stupid drivers, I'm looking forward to the
interesting things that happen during the academic year.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated.

I'm told ``Eat more Kale" \\
Who can deny a sticker? \\
Plus, kale is tasty

2 August 2007

A late night idea \\
Begats a flurry of work \\
Sleep is for the weak 

3 August 2007

Crappiest scissors \\
Making cutting difficult \\
Cramping up my hand

\newpage

I wake up early \\
A rare thing during weekends \\
I got a lot done

Cleaning and cooking \\
Laundry done and put away \\
Domestic today

6 August 2007

As I wander home \\
An ambulance races by \\
Siren screaming loud

7 August 2007

Chocolate craving \\
In my mind all afternoon \\
I buy some candy

8 August 2007

Down the long hallway \\
A box sitting with my mail \\
Unlock with a key

9 August 2007

The sky flickering \\
As rain falls to wet the ground \\
Washing clean the Earth

10 August 2007

Sparkllng and shiny \\
The muffin case at the Mug \\
When the day closes

\newpage

11 August 2007

Sunlight filtering \\
Through blinds in my living room \\
Shows dust in the air


12 August 2007

With a roar it wakes \\
Belching fumes black to the sky \\
Now the bus can go

13 August 2007

The thread descending \\
As a spider builds a home \\
Twisting in the wind

14 August 2007

Slots in abundance \\
My tapes have a lot of room \\
No more crowding here

15 August 2007

On a blade of grass \\
An ant struggles to the top \\
The grass sways; ant falls.

16 August 2007

Yarn intertwining \\
Zigging and zagging around \\
A blanket for warmth

17 August 2007

Along the Huron \\
Children laughing with delight \\
Running with candy

\newpage

18 August 2007

Delightful taffy \\
Pull into long sticky threads \\
Or thwack! to shatter

19 August 2007

Rain runs down my neck \\
Into the co-op, reprise \\
Dreary day passing

20 August 2007

In Centrella Land \\
A new spawn is among us \\
The end times are nigh

21 August 2007

Bold thunder above \\
Smashes down upon the Earth \\
The sky is all grey

22 August 2007

Floating down the street \\
Fragrance of roasting coffee \\
Fills my mind with joy

23 August 2007

Looking on the lawn \\
A Madonna in the park \\
Serene gaze in stone

24 August 2007

Nature sweeps on through \\
While first we cower in fear \\
Later we marvel

\newpage

25 August 2007 

Along the Huron \\
Is an island, small and green \\
There lives the Smeet Frog

26 August 2007

Shining in my eyes \\
A bright yellow ball of light \\
Sits low in the sky

27 August 2007

Chelsea, sweet Chelsea \\
Whispers the train going by \\
Chelsea, sweet Chelsea 

28 August 2007

Jesus looks from on high \\
Watching me drinking my tea \\
A shelf on the wall

29 August 2007

A dead bug hanging \\
From a thread on my windshield \\
How did it get there?

30 August 2007

Grape Nuts and Yogurt \\
I'm trying to bike to work \\
They want to kill me

31 August 2007

Blocking the napkins \\
Lady sweetning espresso \\
Like I'm just not there
