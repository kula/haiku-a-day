The month of September the Dreamland Theater in Ypsilanti
did a movie night series featuring the four Billy Jack 
movies. Each Monday's haiku this month is inspired by that night's
movie. 

The first week of October has brought out the changing of the
leaves here in Ypsilanti. While it may be nearly 80 outside
as I type this, hints of cool nights, piles of crunchy leaves
and pumpkin pie dance in my head.

Download this and previous HADs at the website, so you can
print out you own (DIY, yeah!) or if you want me to send
you one, send me your address, and maybe a stamp if you
are feeling nice. Or send me something you've made ---
trades always appreciated, postcards are nice too.


1 September 2007

Nearly a year past \\
I filled a pod with much junk \\
And now it is back

2 September 2007

Cool September morn \\
Cyclists ride through the country \\
Legs moving them far


\newpage

3 September 2007

Here comes Billy Jack \\
Doing what has to be done \\
Hope, where others fail

4 September 2007

A cup, a plate, spoon \\
You have served my dinner well \\
Rest now in the sink

5 September 2007

I hate you, alarm \\
Sonic scream searing slumber \\
Ruins my good dreams

6 September 2007

Run! For the bus comes \\
Down the avenue quickly \\
Pause, and it is gone

7 September 2007

Who keeps the blanket? \\
Where is it when I'm away? \\
Lying on my couch.

8 September 2007

The crunch of gravel \\
Quiet in the morning light \\
A path to nowhere

9 September 2007

At the light of dawn \\
The new day stirs, waking up \\
Quiet grows busy

\newpage

10 September 2007

One calm, one fury \\
At the Freedom School they meet \\
Strong against the town

11 September 2007

A zephyr stiring \\
Dances past my window shades \\
Clatter in the wind

12 September 2007

Tape library sad \\
It can seek but it can't grab \\
IBM fixes

13 September 2007

``Seek the K-Mart sign \\
That will get you to my place,'' \\
I tell Mom and Dad

14 September 2007

Water flowing on \\
Passes by a mill making \\
True Apple Cider

15 September 2007

Sitting on a hill \\
Behold our mighty tower \\
It gives us water

16 September 2007

Mom and Dad have left \\
On to Canada they go \\
While I do laundry



\newpage

17 September 2007

Stay calm, Billy Jack \\
To find your true inner self \\
Seek the Fourth Level

18 September 2007

I should buy a bed \\
My couch has served well these years \\
But I'm getting old

19 September 2007

Potato! Sublime! \\
O, what mealy love you hide. \\
Crisp skin, soft inside

20 September 2007

My tire was sad \\
And I was late getting up \\
It has been that week

21 September 2007

With a bluish glow \\
A lamp illuminates me \\
Guarding my table

22 September 2007

As I am walking \\
Someone calls me Dumbledore \\
I'm weirdly happy

23 September 2007

The sound of Autumn \\
Crunching leaves beneith my bike \\
Trees slowly sleeping


\newpage

24 September 2007

Mine eyes have seen the \\
Glory of the coming of \\
Billy Jack's Fury

25 September 2007

Sprinklers on wet grass \\
Spray me waiting for the bus \\
And making no sense

26 September 2007

It's morning again \\
And bus riders dodge traffic \\
In Ypsilanti

27 September 2007

Tangy vinegar \\
Transforms the mundane \\
Into pickle joy

28 September 2007

Another Friday \\
The weekend looming head \\
I leave work early

29 September 2007

Spinning fire orbs \\
Describe an arc in the night \\
Whirling and twirling

30 September 2007

I can remember \\
Thirty days hath September \\
The rest eludes me
